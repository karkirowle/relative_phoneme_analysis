10050001 I CAN'T TELL YOU HOW BLESSED THAT FEELS TO BE ABLE TO TALK TO YOU TODAY THIS APRIL THIRD TWO THOUSAND FIFTEEN AND EIGHTEEN MONTHS AGO IN OCTOBER THIRD TWO THOUSAND THIRTEEN I'D THE LEFT HALF 
10050002 HALF OF MY TONGUE REMOVED THAT WAS MY THIRTEENTH SURGERY ALTHOUGH I HAD NUMEROUS SURGERIES AT A CASUAL PACE SINCE BEING DIAGNOSED WITH CANCER IN TWO THOUSAND EIGHT SOMETHING HAD CHANGED 
10050003 CANCER HAD MORPHED INTO A FAST-GROWING AGGRESSIVE CANCER IT HAD TO BE REMOVED QUICKLY WITH SAFE MARGINS IN ORDER TO SAVE MY LIFE DURING THE SURGERY IT BECAME APPARENT THAT CANCER CELLS HAVE SPREAD TO MY LYMPH NODES 
10050004 CAUSING ONE TO BURST LIKE A LIKE A SQUISHED BLUEBERRY AT LEAST THATS HOW MANY SURGEONS DESCRIBED IT AFTER THE SURGERY HAD TO HAPPEN IN SPECIAL SIX WEEKS OF HIGH DOSE CHEMO 
10050005 THERAPY AND THIRTY RADIATION SESSIONS WHICH WORK TOGETHER TO DESTROY THE RESIDUAL CANCER IN MY BODY BUT IT ALSO DESTROYED THE WHITE BLOOD CELL COUNT PRETTY MUCH TO UNDETECTABLE LEVELS WHITE BLOOD 
10050006 CELLS WITH SPECIAL ANGRY LITTLE CELLS THAT HELP THE FIGHT TO KEEP YOU WELL IN HINDSIGHT IT WAS A STUPID IDEA BUT I ALWAYS WANTED TO TRAVEL TO CONSUMER ELECTRONICS SHOW IN LAS VEGAS NEVADA SO WITH A FRIEND JUST 
10050007 WEEKS AFTER MY TREATMENT WAS OVER I WENT TO VEGAS I WAS FLYING IN AN AIRPLANE REBREATHING AIR FULL OF BACTERIA AND VIRUSES THEN ABANDONED A VEGAS IT SPENDS A FEW DAYS WITH A HALF A MILLION PEOPLE FROM ALL OVER THE WORLD 
10050008 I CONTINUALLY HAD TO RETURN THE TRUNK OF OUR RENTAL CAR WHERE WAS A BIG SYRINGE TO SQUEEZE ANOTHER CAN OF FORMULA INTO MY ABDOMINAL TUBE AND RUSHED BACK TO FIGHT THE CROWDS TO SEE THE VARIOUS EXHIBITS ON TECHNOLOGY 
10050009 TO MAKE A LONG STORY SHORT AFTER RETURNING FROM MY TRIP I WAS FOUND THE NEXT MORNING UNDER THE COVERAGE REBREATHING MY OWN AIR I WAS IN COMPLETE RIGOR NON RESPONSIVE BARELY BREATHING 
10050010 THE MEDS HAD TO INTUBATE ME AND GET TO ME THE ICU RIGHT AWAY I WOKE UP A DAY AND A HALF LATER BUT TUBES CAME OUT OF MY THROAT A DOZEN BAGS OF A VARIOUS FLUIDS AND ANTIBIOTICS COMING BY IV 
10050011 DRIP THEY HAD FOUND THAT I HAD PNEUMONIA RESPIRATORY FAILURE AND SYSTEMIC SEPSIS ALL AT THE SAME TIME THAT VERY WEEK MY DAUGHTER'S FRIEND HAD A FATHER THAT DIED IN JUST ONE OF THOSE CONDITIONS 
10050012 AND ALL THREE ACTUALLY COULD HAVE KILLED ME I DON'T KNOW ABOUT YOU WHETHER OR NOT YOU'RE A SPIRITUAL OR RELIGIOUS PERSON BUT MY FRIENDS AND FAMILY THEY PRAYED FERVENTLY FOR ME DURING THE WHOLE PERIOD 
10050013 I'M PERSONALLY NOT A RELIGIOUS MAN I DO GIVE JESUS A CREDIT FOR THIS I DON'T DESERVE TO BE ALIVE I BELIEVE I JUST GETTING A SECOND CHANCE A THIRD CHANCE RELIEF IF WE ARE COUNTING 
10050014 AFTER THE EVENTS I'VE GONE THROUGH THERE ARE SEVERAL KEY TAKEAWAYS THAT I'VE LEARNED NUMBER ONE EVERYBODY DIES BUT NOT EVERYBODY TRULY LIVES NUMBER TWO RATHER THAN WALL 
10050015 THE MINDSET OF WHY ME I ASKED WHY NOT ME LIFE HAPPENS TO ALL OF US NUMBER THREE MY PROBLEMS ARE NO BIGGER THAN YOURS IT ALL COMES DOWN TO LIFE TAKING TWISTS AND TURNS AND 
10050016 DIRECTIONS THAT WE NEVER FORESAW BUT THE PAIN WE FEEL IS THE UNEXPECTED OUTCOMES AND THAT FEELING OF LOSS NUMBER FOUR DON'T LET LIFE GET IN THE WAY OF LIVING IF YOU HAVE BREATH PRESS 
10050017 ON NUMBER FIVE AND MOST IMPORTANTLY I'M BLESSED REGARDLESS OF MY CURRENT CIRCUMSTANCES THE GOOD NEWS IS I'VE BEEN ABLE TO RETURN TO DUMA ABOVE THIS PAST YEAR 
10050018 AND THAT'S TEACHING MY ADVANCED INJURY TREATMENT SEMINARS I'VE HAD TO RELEARN TO SPEAK TO FINDING NEW WAYS TO ENUNCIATE WORDS THAT USUALLY USED TO ROLL OFF OF MY TONGUE AND ARTICULATING A THOUGHT 
10050019 FAR DIFFERENT AND SPEAKING CLEARLY ENOUGH FOR PEOPLE TO UNDERSTAND WHAT YOU'RE SAYING YOU KNOW IT'D BE EASY TO LOOK AT WHAT I DON'T HAVE I DON'T HAVE TWO WORKING VOCAL CORDS I JUST HAVE ONE THAT WORKS 
10050020 AND THE OTHER ONE HANGS FLACCID JUST SO JUST ONE IS WORKING TO SUPPORT MY SPEECH I HAVE A DISFIGURED THROAT NECK FROM MY LYMPH NODE REMOVAL HAVE AN INABILITY TO TASTE FOOD WITH THE EXCEPTION OF BITTER AND SOME 
10050021 SOME SALT I HAVE NO SALIVARY GLANDS SO MOIST OF MY MOUTH AS I EITHER AS I SPEAK I HAVE A TONGUE THAT BARELY HE'S EVEN ABLE TO MOVE FOOD FROM SIDE TO SIDE SO I CAN'T EAT LIKE NORMAL PEOPLE DO 
10050022 I HAVE AN INABILITY TO BREATHE PROPERLY WHEN I SLEEP AND HAVE A SPECIAL POSITIVE AIRWAY DEVICE TO PUSH THROUGH AIR SO I CAN I CAN ACTUALLY BREATHE BUT YOU KNOW WHAT AMONGST ALL 
10050023 THOSE THINGS I'M TRULY BLESSED I HAVE A FAMILY AND FRIENDS AND DAUGHTERS WHO LOVE ME I HAVE A GIRLFRIEND THAT LOVES ME I HAVE A THRIVING BUSINESS THAT PAYS THE BILLS AND ALLOWS ME TO LIVE A LIFE THAT 
10050024 I'VE ALWAYS HOPED FOR I GET TO TRAVEL CONSTANTLY TEACHING HEALTH CARE PROVIDERS HOW TO USE THEIR HANDS TO HELP PEOPLE OUT OF PAIN I HAVE TWO HANDS AND TWO OTHER WORKING LEGS AND ALL MY FINGERS AND TOES 
10050025 AND I CAN TASTE COFFEE I WOKE UP THIS MORNING KNOWING THAT I HAD JUST ONE MORE DAY TO MAKE A DIFFERENCE IN THE WORLD TODAY EVERY DAY I LIVE AS A BELLING THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR YOUR 
10050026 PRAYERS THANKS FOR GIVE ME A CHANCE TO UPDATE YOU BYE BYE 
10060001 IT'S BEEN TWENTY FOUR MONTHS SINCE I HAD MY HEMIGLOSSECTOMY HAVING HALF OF MY TONGUE TAKEN OUT AND I GOT TO TELL YOU IT'S BEEN A BUMPY RIDE BUT I'M SO EXCITED ABOUT THE FUTURE I WAS SCARED 
10060002 I WAS WORRIED THAT THERE'S A PUBLIC SPEAKER THAT'S IN HALF OF THIS TIME HOW COULD I POSSIBLY LIVE LET ALONE MAKE A LIVING DOING WHAT I DO BEST AND THAT'S TEACHING SEMINARS AS I TRAVEL THE COUNTRY 
10060003 YOU KNOW BUT CANCER DOES NOT STOP FOR LIFE YOU'D HAVE THINGS COME ALONG IN LIFE AND CANCER MIGHT BE ONE OF THEM IT'S NOT GOING TO STOP YOU THOUGH SO THIS VIDEO IS NOT JUST FOR 
10060004 THOSE FRIENDS I WANT TO THANK FOR SUPPORTING ME OVER THE LAST TWENTY FOUR MONTHS BUT IT'S ALSO THOSE OF YOU OUT THERE WHO ARE RESEARCHING THIS VERY SCARY PROPOSITION BEING TOLD BY YOUR SURGEON 
10060005 YOU MIGHT LOSE AT LEAST HALF OF YOUR TONGUE TO SAVE YOUR LIFE AND I GOT TO TELL YOU I WAS SCARED BUT I'VE COME THROUGH IT I CAN TALK BETTER I CAN ARTICULATE AND ENUNCIATE 
10060006 AND LEARN NEW WAYS TO SPEAK AND I'VE FOUND THAT THE THE FEAR DOES NOT HELP IT SETS YOU BACK SO LOOK AT WHAT YOU 
10060007 HAVE AND BE COUNTING YOUR BLESSINGS NOT THE THINGS THAT YOU DON'T HAVE BUT LOOK WHAT YOU DO HAVE YOU KNOW IT'S BEEN A HARD YEAR FOR ME TOO I'M REBUILDING MY BUSINESS I'M TRYING TO PAY THE BILLS 
10060008 AND EVERY DAY I'M WORRIED ABOUT WHAT'S GONNA HAPPEN NEXT BUT THAT WORRYING DOESN'T HELP THEM A YEAR AGO IF I HAD TOLD YOU THAT ONE OF US WILL BE DEAD MEANING MYSELF 
10060009 FOR MY ASSISTANT CHARITY LIFE FITNESS AND SHE'S A ULTRA MARATHONER SHE'S A VIVACIOUS WOMAN WHO'S FULL OF LIFE AND SHE WAS TRAGICALLY KILLED JUST A COUPLE MONTHS AGO 
10060010 AND JUST THREW ME OFF IT WAS A HORRIBLE SITUATION AND IT WAS A GRAPHIC SITUATION WHERE SHE DIED AND I WANT TO GO INTO THAT BUT

10130001 HI I'M ROBERT HAASE AND YOU MAY HAVE KNOWN MY STORY SO FAR BUT IF YOU HAVEN'T I WANT TO GIVE AN UPDATE EIGHT MONTHS AGO 
10130002 ON OCTOBER THIRD TWO THOUSAND THIRTEEN I HAD HALF MY TONGUE REMOVED DUE TO FAST GROWING CANCER AND A TUMOR THAT HAD GOT OUT OF CONTROL THEY TOOK THE LEFT HALF 
10130003 AND THEY REPLACED THAT PART OF MY TONGUE WITH PART OF MY ARM AND YOU KNOW MY ARM SHOWS UP AND THE TONGUE IS PRETTY MUCH HEALED FOR THE MOST PART BUT I'M STRONGER GOING THAT THAT PROCESS OF 
10130004 HEALING I'M STILL EYES WERE PAIN BUT NOWHERE NEAR AS MUCH AS I HAD YOU KNOW I BRUSHED MY TEETH AT NIGHT AND MY GUM STOVE THERE'S STILL BLOOD IN THE SINK IT'S JUST 
10130005 STILL HEALING FROM THAT BUT WHEN THE PROCESS OF TESTING MYSELF THEY WERE DOING A BIOPSY AND TOOK OUT A VERY LARGE 
10130006 CHUNK OF TISSUE AT THE BASE OF MY MOUTH AND THAT IS WHAT'S NOT HEALING WHATSOEVER AND THE REASON WAS IS THE TISSUES IN MY TONGUE DON'T HAVE AS MUCH VASCULARITY 
10130007 IS VERY FEW BLOOD VESSELS BY COMPARISON TO WHAT YOUR TONGUE WOULD BE LIKE AND SO IT WASN'T HEALING SO IN RESPONSE THEY DECIDED TO HYPERBARIC CHAMBER TREATMENTS AND I 
10130008 AT THE END OF NEXT WEEK I'VE HAD FORTY FIVE NINETY MINUTE HYPERBARIC TREATMENTS I WENT FROM HAVING PAIN DAILY WHERE I WAS JUST BREAKING INTO 
10130009 TEARS FROM THE PAIN BEING SO OVERWHELMING TO PRETTY MUCH HAVING VERY FEW PAIN MEDS RIGHT NOW AT ALL ACTUALLY ABOUT THREE PILLS A DAY 
10130010 AND SO I'VE HAD ABOUT EIGHT PERCENT REDUCTION IN PAIN MEDICATIONS AND I'M REALLY REALLY HEALING PRETTY WELL SO THAT'S BEEN PRETTY AMAZING I WAS TOLD BACK AT THE END OF MY CHEMOTHERAPY 
10130011 AND RADIATION BACK IN DECEMBER THAT YOU KNOW MY TASTE IS GONE AT THAT POINT AND I WAS TOLD BY JUNE I HAVE MY TASTE BACK IT'S NOT 
10130012 I GUESS A HUNDRED FIFTY FIVE POUNDS WHICH IS A LEAST I'VE BEEN SINCE JUNIOR HIGH AND NOW I'M NOT GETTING MY WEIGHT BACK AT ALL AND I'M EATING A LOT 
10130013 I HAVE ICE CREAM PRETTY MUCH EVERY DAY I KNOW THOSE OF YOU WHO THINKS IT'S DANGEROUS AND IT CAUSES CANCER I APOLOGIZE TO YOU BUT I HAVE FOOD A LOT OF IT EVERY DAY MORE THAN I THINK 
10130014 I CAN POSSIBLY EAT AND I'M STILL NOT GAINING WEIGHT SO SOMEHOW MY METABOLISM CHANGED AND RESET I DON'T RECOMMEND THIS AS A PROCESS FOR LOSING WEIGHT CANCER DIET BUT THE 
10130015 BUT IT DOES SEEM TO WORK FOR ME BUT THAT DECREASE IN TASTE IS MAKING IT HARD TO EAT IN GENERAL YOU CAN TASTE SOME SALT AND BUT NO SWEETS AT ALL 
10130016 I'M DOING A CAT SCAN NEXT WEEK MY CT SCAN THE CAT SCAN IS GOING TO BE NEXT TUESDAY AND THEY'RE LOOKING FOR CANCER 
10130017 THEY WANT TO SEE THEY'RE GOING BEYOND THE PET SCAN AND LOOKING MORE SPECIFICALLY THROUGHOUT MY UPPER TORSO TO SEE IF THERE'S ANY CANCER IN MY BODY STILL LAST TEST I HAD 
10130018 THE TISSUES ON MY MOUTH SPECIFICALLY WHAT WAS CANCER FREE AND WHICH IS AMAZING SO THAT'S AWESOME BUT THE CAT SCAN DIDN'T GIVE MORE SPECIFIC RESULTS AND SO I'M LOOKING 
10130019 FORWARD TO HEARING TO SAFE FROM THAT BUT I JUST WANT TO THANK ALL MY FRIENDS OUT THERE MY SUPPORTERS AND THOSE WHO FOLLOWED ME THROUGH THIS PROCESS AND I'M JUST I'M SO BLESSED TO HAVE YOU 
10130020 AND YOU KNOW YOU'VE BEEN JUST PUSHING ME AND SUPPORTING ME AND I KNOW IT MANY OF YOU THINK OF YOU'RE ON BEYOND TO CALL BEYOND WHAT I SHOULD BE DOING AND LOOK AT MY WEBSITES AND MY BUSINESS I'VE

10130023 I DON'T SPEAK THE WAY I USED TO THIS IS NOT THE VOICE I WOULD HAVE CHOSEN BUT IT'S THE VOICE THAT I'VE BEEN GIVEN I'M LOOKING FORWARD TO USING THAT VOICE TO MAKE A DIFFERENCE IN MY FIELD AS 
10130024 WELL AS TO ENCOURAGE OTHERS SO THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR YOUR PRAYERS AND SUPPORT AND YOUR LOVE IT'S BEEN AN AMAZING JOURNEY AND IT'S NOT OVER WITH YET SO THANKS FOR SEARCHING WITH ME I'LL TALK TO YOU SOON 
10130025 
10180001 THANK YOU SO MUCH LINDA I AM BOTH HONORED AND PRIVILEGED TO STAND BEFORE YOU TODAY MAKING MY DEBUT SPEECH AS AN ORAL CANCER SURVIVOR MY JOURNEY WITH ORAL CANCER STARTED IN FEBRUARY OF 2015
10180002 I MADE A NEW PATIENT EXAM AT A LOCAL DENTIST WE HAD MOVED TO TOWN RELOCATED AND PART OF MY NEW PATIENT EXAM WAS TO HAVE A PANORAMIC
10180003 AND ALSO TO HAVE AN ORAL CANCER SCREENING MY DENTISTS AT THAT TIME NOTICED THAT I HAD A DARK SPOT ON THE PANORAMIC THAT WAS BELOW THE GUM LINES THAT SHE REALLY COULDN'T
10180004 IDENTIFY SHE TOOK ME BACK AND DID AN ADDITIONAL 25 X-RAYS FREE OF CHARGE TOLD ME TAKE THESE TO THE ORAL SURGEON HELP LOCATE THE MASS AND SEE WHAT YOU'RE DEALING WITH
10180005 AND I TOOK THOSE TO THE ORAL SURGEON AND WE LOOKED AND GOT A BETTER IMAGING AND AT THAT POINT YOU MUST REALIZE I WAS THIRTY-FIVE YEAR OLD FEMALE MOTHER OF TWO
10180006 I HAVE AN EIGHT-YEAR-OLD DAUGHTER AND A ONE-YEAR-OLD SON HEALTHY I HAD NO SIGN NO SYMPTOMS NO PAIN THERE WAS NO SYMPTOMS OR ANY CLUES
10180007 THAT WOULD LEAD YOU TO THINK THAT THIS WOULD BE THE CASE WE TOOK BETTER IMAGING AT THE ORAL SURGEON AND THEY REALIZED MY MASS WAS THE SIZE OF A GOLF BALL GROWING INSIDE MY RIGHT MANDIBLE
10180008 SLOWLY SEPARATING MY JAWS IT WAS EVENTUALLY GOING TO BREAK IT SO AT THAT POINT WE TOOK A A WISDOM TOOTH DID A BIOPSY AND SENT IT OFF TO BE HAVE A BIOPSY
10180009 AND TWO WEEKS LATER THE RESULTS CAME IN WE ALL WENT MY HUSBAND AND I SCARED TO DEATH GOT THE BEST NEWS EVER HE SAID YOU'RE CANCER-FREE
10180010 IT'S WONDERFUL WE JUST NEED TO SEND YOU DOWN TO MU SC AND YOU NEED TO HAVE IT REMOVED BECAUSE OF THE SIZE AND LOCATION IT'S JUST TOO LARGE FOR ME TO DO IN THE OFFICE SO TWO WEEKS LATER
10180011 AGAIN WE WENT IN FOR THE AND THE HEAD OF THE DENTAL PRACTICE WALKED IN AND SAID I KNOW YOU'RE WORRIED ABOUT YOUR PATHOLOGY I SAID NO THIS GUY THAT GUY RIGHT THERE SAID EVERYTHING WAS FINE
10180012 AND HE SAID ACTUALLY IT REACTED POORLY WITH THE K-19 DYE AND WE'VE NEVER SEEN THIS BEFORE WE NEED TO READ BIOPSY BUT LET'S GO AHEAD TAKE IT OUT AS A MASS IN WHOLE
10180013 BIOPSY THE WHOLE SURFACE AND THEN DEAL FROM THERE SO WE WENT IN AND HAD IT REMOVED AND THEY TOLD MY HUSBAND IT WAS CLEAR THERE WAS NO NODULES THAT LOOKED VERY FINE
10180014 AND THERE SHOULDN'T BE ANYTHING TO WORRY ABOUT ANOTHER TWO WEEKS PASSED WE GOT THE PATHOLOGY REPORT HAD OUR APPOINTMENT DROVE TO CHARLESTON WHICH IS ABOUT A FOUR-HOUR DRIVE FROM CHARLOTTE THAT'S WHERE ALL MY DOCTORS ARE
10180015 AND WE WERE SITTING THERE AND I TOOK MY CHILDREN MY ONE-YEAR-OLD SON MY EIGHT-YEAR-OLD DAUGHTER AND NINE DOCTORS WALKED IN THE ROOM AND I JUST KNEW AT THAT MOMENT
10180016 THIS POINT WAS NOT GOING THE WAY WE THOUGHT IT WAS GONNA GO SO I REMEMBER SITTING THERE STARING AT MY CHILDREN AS THE WORDS CAME OUT OF THE DOCTORS MOUTHS THEY SAID WE'VE NEVER SEEN
10180017 THIS TYPE OF CANCER BEFORE WE DON'T KNOW HOW TO TREAT IT CHEMO AND RADIATION AREN'T EFFECTIVE ON IT THERE'S LESS THAN 80 CASES IN THE WHOLE ENTIRE WORLD SINCE IT WAS DERIVED
10180018 IN THE 80S I THOUGHT I SAID WHAT AM I SUPPOSED TO DO I WALKED OUT BY ANIMAL AND YOU'LL WANT TO GO FIRST THING I DID I TRIED TO WEBMD MYSELF INTO A DIFFERENT DIAGNOSIS
10180019 BUT THERE WAS NO INFORMATION NO RESEARCH NO STUDIES EVERYTHING WAS IN THE EARLY 80S AND IT WAS IN THIRD WORLD COUNTRIES IT METASTASIZED INTO
10180020 LUNG CANCER AND THE THE TRUTH AND THE HARSH REALITY BEHIND IT IS IS THERE'S NOT ANY SURVIVORS BECAUSE IT KILLS US WITHIN FIVE YEARS SO THE OFFICIAL DIAGNOSIS WAS CLEAR CELL
10180021 ANDROGENICAL CARCINOMA AND I WAS TOLD AT THAT TIME I WAS THE ONLY PERSON IN THE WORLD WITH THIS CANCER I LEFT THERE WITH NOWHERE TO TURN
10180022 NOBODY TO TALK TO THERE WASN'T A SUPPORT GROUP THERE WASN'T A FOUNDATION THERE WASN'T ANYTHING THAT COULD HELP ME SO FOR A MONTH MY HUSBAND AND I RESEARCHED THE BEST TO
10180023 OUR ABILITIES ON OUR OWN WE BOUGHT ALL THE CASE STUDIES FROM BACK IN THE DAY READ THEM NO KNOWN SURVIVORS AND REALLY DEALT WITH WHAT WAS FACING US AND ALAN
10180024 WHIM I DECIDED TO MAKE A GOFUNDME PAGE REALLY DIDN'T RAISE ANY MONEY BUT WITHIN 24 HOURS OF IT GOING VIRAL AND SOCIAL MEDIA I HAD AN EMAIL IN MY INBOX
10180025 FROM LINDA MILES AND SHE SAID I CAN HELP YOU CALL ME I KNOW WHAT TO DO AND NOT KNOWING LINDA OR OF ORAL CANCER CAUSE OR REALLY ANY FOUNDATION
10180026 THAT COULD HELP IN ANY WAY I REACHED OUT AND I CONTACTED HER AND SHE CONNECTED ME WITH A WOMAN WHO HAD BEEN IN SAN ANTONIO WHO HAD HAD A JAW REPLACEMENT AND KNEW THE TYPE OF SURGERY THAT I WAS FACING
10180027 THINGS LIKE THAT THEN SHE ALSO MENTIONED YOU KNOW I'VE HEARD OF THIS CANCER BEFORE I SAID EXCUSE ME SHE SAID WE HELPED ANOTHER FAMILY LAST YEAR SAME DIAGNOSIS
10180028 I SAID ARE YOU SERIOUS AND WITHIN THE SAME DAY I WAS ON THE PHONE WITH THE ONLY OTHER KNOWN SURVIVOR WITH THIS TYPE OF CANCER I SMILED I CALL MY CANCER BROTHER
10180029 AND WE ARE IMMEDIATE FAMILY THERE'S NO KNOWN ROUTE TO WHY WE HAVE THIS DISEASE THERE'S NOT IT WAS AN ENVIRONMENTAL IT'S NOT HEREDITARY THERE'S NO WAY TO STOP IT
10180030 IT'S 95 PERCENT AGGRESSIVE HE'S BEEN DIAGNOSED FOR THREE YEARS ON HIS SECOND REOCCURRENCE ALREADY AT THIS POINT JUST FINISHED HIS LAST SURGERY YES TWO WEEKS AGO
10180031 AND HE'S IN RECOVERY SO THE HARSH REALITY IS IS WE HAVE TO CHECK FOR ORAL CANCER WE HAVE TO BE DOING SCREENINGS MY CANCER WAS RARE UNDER THE TISSUE MAY NOT HAVE BEEN NOTICED
10180032 BUT I HAD A DENTIST WHO PAID ATTENTION TO THAT IMAGING AND SAW A TINY LITTLE DARK SPOT THAT CHANGED MY LIFE MY CANCER WOULD HAVE KILLED ME WITHIN SIX MONTHS IF I HAD NOT
10180033 FOUND IT AND SO I'M ONLY ABLE TO STAND HER TODAY BEFORE YOU BECAUSE OF A DENTIST WHO DID THEIR JOB AND WENT ABOVE THE STANDARD CARE PRACTICE AND BECAUSE OF
10180034 THE ORAL CANCER PAUSE AND THE WORK THAT THEY DO THEY SENT US A CHECK WHICH ALLOWED ME TO PUT MY SON IN DAYCARE I DIDN'T KNOW THAT THIS THAT YOU SEE NOW
10180035 MY TISSUE WAS ACTUALLY BONE AND TISSUE TAKEN FROM MY SCAPULA TO REPLACE IN HERE ALONG WITH A TITANIUM PLATE BUT TO LOOK AT MY ONE-YEAR-OLD SON AND KNOW THAT I WAS GOING TO GO THROUGH A RECOVERY
10180036 AND NOT BE ABLE TO PICK HIM UP AND CARRY HIM I DIDN'T KNOW WHAT TO DO THEY GAVE ME THE OPPORTUNITY TO PUT HIM IN DAY CARE AND CARE FOR HIM WHILE I WENT THROUGH RECOVERY AND THAT IS SOMETHING THAT I COULD NEVER PAY
10180037 THESE LADIES BACK FOR SO IF YOU HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY TO SUPPORT A FOUNDATION THEY DO WONDERFUL WORK
10210001 HI EVERYONE I'M JUST HERE TO GIVE YOU MY ONE-YEAR FINDING OUT ABOUT MY TONGUE CANCER UPDATE 
10210002 UM JUST TO LET YOU KNOW WHAT I HAD I HAD TONGUE CANCER THEY CUT IT OUT 
10210003 THERE I CUT MY NECK HERE TO THE BACK AND THEY REMOVED THE LYMPH NODES I TESTED THEM ONE OF THEM THEY SAW METASTASES 
10210004 SO THEY WENT AHEAD AND REMOVED THE OTHER ONES NEXT LEVEL I THINK THE CUTS HERE AND THEY ALSO OPENED THIS AGAIN 
10210005 AND REMOVED THE BOTTOM ONES THERE SO BASICALLY THIS WAS THE FIRST SURGERY IN MY TONGUE AND HERE NO SECOND ONE WAS HERE AGAIN 
10210006 AND DOWN HERE THEN AFTER THAT ABOUT A MONTH LATER I HAD THE CHEMOTHERAPY START WITH CISPLATIN 
10210007 AND THEN THIRTY FIVE SESSIONS MONDAY THROUGH FRIDAY OF THE RADIATION WHICH THEY GOT ME BASICALLY IN THIS 
10210008 AREA I DIDN'T LOSE MY HAIR FROM THE CHEMOTHERAPY BECAUSE AFTER THE FIRST ONE FOR THE FIRST CISPLATIN AND I GOT 
10210009 AFTER THE SECOND ONE SORRY I GOT A LITTLE BIT SICK I THINK IT WAS JUST TOO MUCH MEDICINE IN MY BODY SO THEY WENT AHEAD AND GAVE ME LIKE AN 
10210010 ANTIBODY FOR THE THIRD CHEMOTHERAPY SO I DIDN'T LOSE MY HAIR OR ANYTHING BUT THE CHEMOTHERAPY WASN'T A BIG DEAL BUT THE RADIATION 
10210011 THAT ACTUALLY LOST MY HAIR KIND OF ON A BACK HERE IT'S GROWING BACK NOW A YEAR LATER MAYBE TWO INCHES LONG SO 
10210012 JUST DOWN HERE THIS WHOLE BOTTOM SECTION SLOWLY FELL OUT AS YOU CAN MAYBE HEAR I CAN'T SAY MY SS IS 
10210013 VERY WELL IT KIND OF SOUNDS LIKE AN AS H. AND I HAVE DRY MOUTH SO I CARRY WATER WITH ME 
10210014 EVERYWHERE AND ALSO AND LET'S SEE I CAN'T TASTE FOOD AS MUCH I CAN IT'S COMING BACK SLOWLY BUT IT'S DEFINITELY 
10210015 NOT HUNDRED PERCENT AND I THINK I DON'T THINK IT WILL COME BACK HUNDRED PERCENT BUT WHO KNOWS IT'S ONLY A YEAR OUT WATER TASTES A LITTLE BIT 
10210016 STRANGE TO ME NOW I CAN'T REALLY HAVE A LOT OF VINEGAR ACIDIC FOOD I THINK YOU HAVE PHRASE SYNDROME NOW WHERE 
10210017 BECAUSE I LOST SOME OF THE SALIVARY GLANDS THE RADIATION PRETTY MUCH KILLS ABOUT FORTY PERCENT SO NOW 
10210018 SINCE I DON'T REALLY SALIVATE THAT MUCH I THINK THE NERVES THAT WERE KILLED END UP GOING INTO LIKE YOUR SKIN ON THE SURFACE OF YOUR FACE SO IF I 
10210019 HAVE SOMETHING THAT'S ACIDIC OR SALTY OR SPICY WHICH I CAN'T HAVE TOO MUCH SPICY STUFF LIKE YEAH I USED TO IT 
10210020 BECAUSE THIS IS TOO MUCH PAIN BUT I'LL START TO SWEAT HERE AND ABOVE MY BROW LIKE KETCHUP YEAH IT'S REALLY PAINFUL 
10210021 ANYWAY SEE WHAT ELSE OTHER WAYS IT AFFECTED MY LIFE AND SPEECH SAYING THAT MORE CONSCIOUS ABOUT MY SPEECH SOME PEOPLE SAY 
10210022 THEY DON'T NOTICE IT BUT I NOTICE EVERY TIME I SAY AN S. WORD SOMETIMES MY VOICE CHANGES I THINK MY VOICE 
10210023 IS A LITTLE BIT DEEPER NOW AND SO AND SOMETIMES EVEN IN AFTERNOON IT SOUNDS LIKE I HAVE MORNING VOICE 
10210024 WHAT ELSE I DON'T KNOW HERE MY NECK SINCE I CUT HERE AND THE RADIATION THIS MUSCLE HERE IS 
10210025 AS YOU CAN SEE IT'S KIND OF STICKING OUT IS REALLY TIGHT AND SO I CAN LEAN MY HEAD ABOUT THIS FAR BUT ON THE OTHER SIDE I CAN GO 
10210026 A LOT FURTHER I CAN'T REALLY TURN MY HEAD A LOT BEFORE I FEEL IT START TO PULL BUT DOESN'T REALLY HURT THAT MUCH 
10210027 AND YEAH AND THEN JUST THAT JUST THE TONGUE THE VOLUME IS LESS OVER HERE 
10210028 AND THEN THE RADIATION ALSO MESSES UP YOUR GUMS SO MY TEETH LIKE THE ROOT OF MY TEETH ON BOTH THE TOP AND THE BOTTOM 
10210029 ARE PAINFUL LIKE IF I DRINK SOMETHING THAT'S NOT WRONG A LITTLE BIT WARM AND I CAN FEEL THE PAIN IN MY GUMS AND 
10210030 DOWN ON MY TEETH LIKE ON THE BOTTOM THERE IT'S A LITTLE BIT MORE EXPOSED AND THEN YOU HAVE ALL KINDS OF FUN ENAMEL PROBLEMS AND THINGS 
10210031 LIKE THAT BECAUSE YOU DON'T HAVE THE HEALTHY BACTERIA IN YOUR MOUTH SO YOU HAVE TO KEEP BRUSHING AND FLOSSING AND DOING ALL THAT STUFF THE ORAL CARE INCREASES 
10210032 NEXT THING I'M BASICALLY TRYING TO PREVENT THE CANCER FROM COMING BACK SO MY FAVORITE THING TO DO IS PHYSICAL ACTIVITY I'VE BEEN ON 
10210033 MY BIKE A LOT BUT ALSO I'M WATCHING EVERYTHING THAT GOES IN MY MOUTH AND I FOUND THIS BOOK IS REALLY HELPFUL 
10210034 THIS IS THE GERSON THERAPY IT'S A NATURAL WAY TO CURE CANCER BUT I'M KIND OF USING IT AS A PREVENT THE CANCER FROM RECURRING 
10210035 SO I'M USING THE COFFEE ENAMELS AND THE CARROT APPLE JUICES EVERY DAY AND MAKES ME FEEL PRETTY 
10210036 HEALTHY I'M ALSO IN A PLACE WHERE I HAVE ACCESS TO ISCADOR IT'S ALSO CALLED MISSILE ISCADOR 
10210037 IT'S ALSO CALLED MISTLETOE THERAPY IT'S BASICALLY IT'S MADE BY THE COMPANY WELEDA OR LOOKS LIKE WELEDA 
10210038 BUT IT'S GERMAN THESE ARE THE LOW BACK PILLS AND I OPEN THEM UP AND PUT 
10210039 THOSE INJECT THEM INTO MY BODY MONDAY THROUGH FRIDAY THREE TIMES A WEEK AND AND THAT'S SUPPOSED TO 
10210040 PREVENT THE CANCER FROM COMING BACK AS WELL AS WE HAVE A PART OF THE TREATMENT IS EVERY TWO WEEKS I TAKE A HIGH DOSE OF VITAMIN D BECAUSE EVEN THOUGH I'M IN THE SUNSHINE ALL THE TIME 
10210041 AND I RIDE MY BIKE AND EVERYTHING AND IT'S STILL NOT ENOUGH I GUESS BECAUSE THE UV OR THE EVERYTHING IN ATMOSPHERE IS PREVENTING US FROM REALLY 
10210042 GETTING THAT VITAMIN SO I TAKE IT SO I TAKE A SUPPLEMENT AND THEN I JUST TRIED TO ELIMINATE LIKE I'M ON THE BIKE ALL THE TIME I THINK I WAS DRINKING A LOT FROM 
10210043 PLASTIC BOTTLES AND WE KNOW THE PLASTIC ISN'T GOOD SO I HAVE SINCE SWITCHED OVER I DROPPED THE MONEY AND PAID FOR THE KLEAN KANTEEN 
10210044 STAINLESS STEEL BOTTLE COMES THE CAP OR YOU CAN GET ONE WITHOUT THIS PIECE IT JUST SCREWS ON AND IT 
10210045 FITS INTO MY WATER BOTTLE HOLDER SO STAINLESS STEEL THE WAY TO GO AND WITH EVERYTHING POTS AND PANS GET RID OF ALUMINUM 
10210046 ALUMINUM IS ALSO IN YOUR DEODORANT SO THEY HAVE THESE LITTLE IT'S LIKE A CRYSTAL STICK YOU JUST PUT WATER ON IT AND THIS IS MY DEODORANT 
10210047 I'VE GONE TO ORGANIC HAIR PRODUCTS AND CLEANERS I THINK THEY EVEN THIS CAN BE AT WALMART ORGANICS 
10210048 IT'S JUST LIKE A GEL BUT I HAVE THE SHAMPOO AS WELL ALSO THIS PRODUCT IS THE MOST AMAZING THING ESPECIALLY WHEN YOU'RE IN HOSPITAL AND YOU DON'T GET THE 
10210049 SHOWER EVERY DAY IT IS THE DR. BRONNER'S MAGIC SOAP IT IS AWESOME THIS IS WHAT I USED TO WASH MY HANDS NOW WASH MY FACE UM 
10210050 SINCE I HAVE THE CANCER UP HERE I'M TRYING TO GET RID OF ALL THE PARAFFINS AND ALL THE CHEMICALS AND THINGS THAT I PUT ON MY HEAD ON MY FACE AND 
10210051 I MEAN I DON'T EVEN LIKE TO USE LOTION ANYMORE BECAUSE ALL THAT STUFF IS GOING INTO YOUR SKIN SO I ADVISE THE PEPPER MERC SMELLS GOOD 
10210052 AND WHAT ELSE PROBABLY THAT'S MOSTLY IT I'M JUST TRYING TO 
10210053 WRAP MY HEAD AROUND ALL THIS IT'S COMING UP ON A YEAR AND I HAVE A PET C. T. SCAN IN A FEW WEEKS I WAS ACTUALLY GOING TO WAIT FOR MY ONE-YEAR ANNIVERSARY 
10210054 ON HALLOWEEN TO MAKE THIS VIDEO BUT I COULDN'T MAKE ANY LONGER I REALLY WANTED TO COMMUNICATE THIS WITH THE COMMUNITY OUT THERE WHO ARE YOUNG 
10210055 I'M ONLY THIRTY ONE NOW I WAS DIAGNOSED WHEN I WAS THIRTY AND YOU KNOW IT WAS ONLY A MONTH LATER THAT 
10210056 I WENT AHEAD AND HAD THE SURGERY SO THE KEY THING IS WHEN YOU SEE SOMETHING FUNNY ON YOUR TONGUE IT HURTS JUST LIKE A TYPICAL ULCER 
10210057 AFTER TWO WEEKS YOU NEED TO GO GET IT CHECKED OUT AND A LOT OF DENTISTS DON'T EVEN KNOW WE WON'T KNOW WHAT IT IS THEY'LL JUST SAY IT'S A SORE THEY'LL GIVE YOU A CREAM 
10210058 HAVE THEM DO THE BIOPSY IF IT'S BEEN MORE THAN TWO WEEKS BECAUSE A LOT OF TIMES THEY'LL FIND THAT IT'S CANCEROUS IF IT'S IF IT'S STARTING TO GROW I MEAN MINE WAS ABOUT MMM 
10210059 LIKE THIS ON THE BASE OF MY TONGUE ABOUT ONE AND A HALF CENTIMETERS LONG BY ABOUT ONE CENTIMETER HIGH AND I'M NOT SURE HOW DEEP IT WENT IN BUT 
10210060 THEY THINK THAT DIDN'T REALLY SPREAD JUST TILL THAT ONE LYMPH NODE BUT WHEN THEY FIND IT IN ONE THEY TAKE ALL OF THEM OUT BECAUSE THEY WANT TO BE 
10210061 SAFE AND THEN THEY JUST GIVE ME ALL THE THE HIGHEST LEVEL I GUESS OF RADIATION THAT WOULD KILL ANYTHING ELSE THAT 
10210062 WAS POSSIBLY IN THERE BUT NOW I'M TRYING TO YOU KNOW USE SOME OF THESE ALTERNATIVE METHODS AND PREVENT IT FROM REOCCURRING AND YEAH 
10210063 I THINK THAT'S ALL I HAVE FOR NOW IF YOU HAVE ANY QUESTIONS FEEL FREE TO POST THEM I'LL PROBABLY I'LL PROBABLY PUT SOME LINKS WHERE YOU CAN FIND SOME OF THE PRODUCTS IF YOU'RE NOT SURE AND MOST OF THESE PRODUCTS 
10210064 YOU CAN ALMOST ALL OF THEM YOU CAN GET IN THE UNITED STATES AND SOME OF THEM I HAD MY FAMILY SEND I'M OUT OF THE COUNTRY NOW SO I HAD THEM SEND 
10210065 THEM TO ME I'VE ALSO HAD ONE THING DURING THE RADIATION I HAD A LOT OF PAIN I HAD MUCOSIS AND MY 
10210066 MOUTH WAS COMPLETELY DRY AND I COULDN'T EVEN DRINK WATER I HAD HAD TO GET A FEEDING TUBE MY MOUTH HAD CUTS AND SORES EVERYTHING ALL OVER 
10210067 I DID USE A PRODUCT CALLED DUVAN IT'S JUVEN GO JUVEN DOT COM IT'S SUPPOSED TO HELP 
10210068 YOUR SKIN HEAL QUICKER ESPECIALLY IF YOU HAVE SCARS AND THINGS LIKE THAT SOME PEOPLE DON'T EVEN NOTICE MY SCAR BECAUSE IT'S KIND OF IN THE FOLD OF THE NECK BUT UM 
10210069 BUT I THINK IT ALSO HELPS WITH THE TONGUE SO I FEEL LIKE THAT WAS A REALLY GOOD PRODUCT THAT I USED DURING CHEMO THE RADIATION ALL OF THAT SO THE SOONER YOU 
10210070 CAN GET THAT THE BETTER AND DO IT FOR AS LONG AS YOU CAN AFFORD IT CUZ IT'S NOT CHEAP BUT I THINK IT'S REALLY WORTH IT DOING LET'S JUST GET THE NON-FLAVORED 
10210071 POWDER MIX IT IN WITH YOUR DRINK AND TWO TIMES A DAY AND I THINK IT REALLY HELPED MY TONGUE TO HEAL 
10210072 AND THEN THE MORPHINE LIKE I SAID THE MORPHINE TO HELP I WAS IN THE HOUSE WAS ALSO UM YEAH I WAS LOOKING FOR SOME AMERICAN MEDICAL MARIJUANA 
10210073 HERE WHEN I'M AT BUT I COULDN'T REALLY GET IT BECAUSE I'M IN A DIFFERENT COUNTRY BUT I I WOULD I WAS AT THE POINT WHERE I WAS CONSIDERING DOING THAT BECAUSE I 
10210074 WAS IN SO MUCH PAIN BUT YEAH I GUESS THAT'S ALL I HAVE FOR NOW IF YOU HAVE ANY QUESTIONS UHM FEEL FREE 
10210075 TO ASK ME AND YEAH ALL I CAN SAY IS GOOD LUCK AND SAY YOUR PRAYERS BECAUSE IT'S A TOUGH PROCESS BUT YOU CAN GET THROUGH IT 
10210076 HERE I AM A YEAR LATER AND UHM YEAH STILL EATING STILL ALIVE STILL GOING WE WILL SEE HOW THE SCAN GOES IN 
10210077 IN A WEEK OR TWO BUT GOOD LUCK STAY STRONG AND WELL MAYBE I'LL DO A TWO YEAR UPDATE WILL SEE ALRIGHT SEE YA 
10220001 ON OCTOBER THIRD OF TWO THOUSAND FIFTEEN DOCTOR STEVEN BALES OF VIRGINIA MASON HOSPITAL IN SEATTLE WASHINGTON REMOVED HALF OF MY TONGUE THE LEFT HALF THE PROCEDURE CALLED 
10220002 A HEMIGLOSSECTOMY AND I'M HAPPY TO REPORT THAT FIVE YEARS AND TWO DAYS LATER I AM STILL DANCING WITH NED THEY SAYING NO EVIDENCE OF DISEASE 
10220003 AND I'M STILL CANCER-FREE AND SO I JUST WANT REPORT THAT OUT SO YOU ALL UP TO SPEED IT'S WHAT'S HAPPENING WITH MY MY PROCESS IF YOU FOLLOWED MY STORY YOU'LL KNOW THAT WAS FIRST DIAGNOSED 
10220004 WITH SQUAMOUS CELL CARCINOMA OR TONGUE CANCER IN TWO THOUSAND EIGHT DOCTOR CARL MYERS I REMEMBER THE MORNING HE CALLED ME ON SEPTEMBER TWENTY NINTH AND HE SAID THE 
10220005 BOB I'VE GOT I'VE GOT HARD NEWS HE SAID YOU'VE UH YOU'VE BEEN DIAGNOSED WITH CANCER IT IS INDEED CANCER YOU'VE GOT AND MY HEART SANK AT THAT MOMENT 
10220006 I WAS THINKING LIKE WOW DRIVING TO HAVE A FUTURE IF YOU HAD TOLD ME YOU KNOW TEN YEARS LATER I'D BE STILL HERE DOING WHAT I'M DOING I'M NOT SURE WHAT IT BELIEVES YOU I WAS VERY SCARED AND FRIGHTENED AT THAT POINT 
10220007 YOU KNOW I FINISHED MY CHEMOTHERAPY AND RADIATION THERAPIES IT LEFT ME SOMETHING I WOULD CALL BONUS TIME YOU KNOW THAT THOSE THERAPIES ARE HORRENDOUS BUT YET THEY GIVE YOU EXTRA 
10220008 OPPORTUNITY OF LIFE AND YOU KNOW I'VE BEEN ABLE TO HAVE A CHANCE TO SPEND TIME AND BLESS PEOPLE AND ENCOURAGE THEM AND PEOPLE GOING THROUGH THEIR OWN ADVERSITIES NOT JUST CANCER BUT 
10220009 YOU KNOW IF LOTS OF PEOPLE WHO'VE LOST THEIR JOBS LOST THEIR MARRIAGES LOST SO YOU KNOW THEIR BUSINESS OR THEIR HOME OR YOU KNOW FROM WORST LOST A CHILD AND YOU KNOW 
10220010 ALL OF IT BOILS DOWN TO ONE COMMON WORD AND THAT'S LOSS I LOST HALF MY TONGUE I LOST A LOT OF STUFF BUT THE THE WHOLE IDEA OF A FIRST IS THAT LOST PIECE AND 
10220011 YOU KNOW IS YOU KNOW YOU KNOW I LOST MY MY BUSINESS MY MY HOUSE MY CAR MY WIFE LEFT OUR MARRIAGE 
10220012 AND I GOT CANCER ALL IN A VERY SHORT PERIOD OF TIME AND IT SOUNDS HORRIBLE BUT YET AT THE SAME TIME IS IT'S EASY TO FOCUS ON WHAT WE DON'T HAVE AND NOT FOCUS ON WHAT WE DO 
10220013 HAVE AND THAT THAT AMONG THINGS THAT DID STEAL FROM ME WAS MY INVINCIBILITY YOU KNOW WE THINK WE'RE ALL IMMORTAL WE'RE NOT GONNA DIE WE DON'T THINK ABOUT DEATH WE DON'T WANT TO THINK ABOUT DEATH AND WE 
10220014 BUT BEING FACED WITH THAT I REALIZE WOW I MIGHT DIE SOMEDAY YOU KNOW I KNOW THAT SOUNDS SILLY BUT THAT WAS A HUGE THING FOR ME REALIZED I'M MORTAL 
10220015 AND THIS IS A POSSIBILITY THAT COULD HAPPEN SO BUT BEING ABLE TO CARE FOR FAMILY AND FRIENDS AND STILL BE HERE IT'S A HUGE BLESSING SO THOSE EXTRA 
10220016 YEARS I'VE HAD SO FAR AS THESE LAST FIVE HAVE BEEN I'VE BEEN AWESOME THERE'S A EXPRESSION THAT I'VE HEARD AND YOU'VE PROBABLY HEARD BEFORE THAT IT'S NOT SO MUCH LIFE IS A JOURNEY 
10220017 BUT IT'S NOT A DESTINATION YOU KNOW SO LIFE IS NOT ABOUT GETTING SOMEWHERE OR THE GOALS WE HAVE TO GET SOMEWHERE IT'S ABOUT THAT PROCESS ALONG THE WAY IN TWO THOUSAND FIFTEEN 
10220018 I HAD LOST MY TEACHING ASSISTANT SHERRY WAISHUN AS SHE'VE BEEN TEACHING WITH ME FOR GOSH NINE YEARS TOTAL I THINK AT THAT POINT AND AN AMAZING WOMAN AND A 
10220019 GOOD FRIEND AND SHE WAS TAKEN FROM ME SHE AND HER HUSBAND WERE INVOLVED IN A SPORTING INCIDENT WHERE SHE WAS KILLED TRAGICALLY AND YOU KNOW 
10220020 HUGE LOSS THAT YEAR BUT IN THE SAME TIME THAT YEAR I I MET THE WOMAN I'M MARRIED TO NOW I MET KAREN AND SHE WAS A HUGE BLESSING TO ME SO YOU KNOW LIFE THROWS YOU ALL KINDS OF THINGS AND 
10220021 AND OUR FOCUS IS A HUGE HUGE PIECE OF HOW WE'RE GONNA SUCCEED IN THAT IT'S EASY TO LET THE LOSS AND HARDSHIP WE HAVE 
10220022 IT'S EASY TO FOCUS ON THAT AND HAVE IT JUST KIND OF ENTRAP OUR ENTIRE ATTENTION AND FOCUS NOT WE DON'T HAVE OUR FOCUSING SO MUCH WHAT WE'VE LOST AND WE DON'T HAVE WE FORGET WHAT WE DO HAVE 
10220023 SO MAYBE A PARENT LOST A CHILD AND THEY'RE FORGETTING THE FACT IF YOU HAVE TWO OTHERS THAT THEY'RE NOT SPENDING TIME WITH BECAUSE THEY'RE SO SO FOCUSED ON WHAT THEY DON'T HAVE ANYMORE IN THAT 
10220024 SO I WOULD JUST ENCOURAGE YOU TO FOCUS ON WHAT YOU DO HAVE FOCUS ON THE BLESSINGS IN LIFE AND BLESSINGS ARE COMING YOUR WAY ALONG THAT PROCESS YOU KNOW NOW I HAVE A WIFE THAT LOVES ME DEARLY I'VE GOT 
10220025 THREE DAUGHTERS WHO I JUST LOVE INCREDIBLY I'M VERY PROUD OF THEM I HAVE PARENTS IN THE EIGHTIES WHO ARE THRIVING AND DOING WELL I'M BACK TO TEACHING SEMINARS 
10220026 THAT I LOVE NATIONALLY YOU KNOW I I EVEN HAD TO GO TO EUROPE LAST YEAR AND DRIVE THE AUTOBAHN AND DECREASING FROM HUNDRED HUNDRED AND TWENTY MILES 
10220027 PER HOUR FOR QUITE A WHILE THAT WAS JUST LIKE YOU KNOW A DREAM OF MINE AND I HAD NO IDEA THE AMAZING THINGS THAT WERE GOING TO COME AFTER HAVING CHEMOTHERAPY 
10220028 RADIATION AND THINKING I WAS GOING TO BE GONE SO THE BUSES ARE THERE THE REST IS VIDEOS FOR PEOPLE WHO'VE HAD HEMIGLOSSECTOMY OR 
10220029 ABOUT TO HAVE ONE OR MAYBE FRIENDS AND FAMILY WHO ARE DOING RESEARCH AND TRYING TO SUPPORT SOMEBODY WHO'S GONE THROUGH ONE OR IS ABOUT TO GO THROUGH ONE SO HE WAS SOME INFORMATION SPECIFICS 
10220030 THINGS THAT I'VE BEEN THROUGH THE LAST FIVE YEARS MAYBE HERE'S SOME THINGS YOU MIGHT NOT EXPECT THINGS I WASN'T TOLD THAT MIGHT HAPPEN SO I'LL GO THROUGH THOSE BUT 
10220031 BEFORE I TALK ABOUT THE NEGATIVES AGAIN REGARDLESS WHAT THE NEGATIVE SIDE EFFECTS AND ALL THE STUFF THAT'S BAD THE NUMBER ONE THING IS I'M ALIVE IT'S I'M ALIVE TO EVEN COMPLAIN AND 
10220032 PEOPLE THINK WOW I HAVE ALL THESE PROBLEMS BUT YEAH BUT YOU'RE ALIVE YOU KNOW SO THE DOWNSIDE OF TREATMENT YOU SHOULD LIVE AND THAT'S THE WHOLE POINT OF A TREATMENT IS TO EXTEND THAT LIFE OPPORTUNITY 
10220033 SO SIDE EFFECTS WISE THERE ARE NUMEROUS ONES THAT I'VE HAD ACTUALLY PROBABLY NEARLY ALMOST TWO DOZEN BUT THE BIGGER ONES THAT I HAVE ARE HAVING AN EFFECT 
10220034 BACK THE FIRST ONE WAS A SHOW UP WAS CALLED ORNATE SIGN WHICH IN MY GO FOR A WALK OR SOMETHING EVEN DURING TREATMENT I PUT MY CHIN TO MY CHEST AND IT BE THE SUDDEN SURGE A 
10220035 THE PAINFUL SURGE IN MY LOWER BODY BECAUSE I ALMOST NUMB AND TINGLY AND JUST BECOME A WEAK ALL AT ONCE AND THAT'S SOMETHING THAT CAME SPECIFICALLY BECAUSE I HAD A CHEMOTHERAPY CALLED 
10220036 CISPLATIN WITH CERVICAL RADIATION THAT COMBINATION SOME PEOPLE DOES CAUSE ORNATE SIGN AND SO BE AWARE OF THAT IT'S NOT GONNA 
10220037 KILL ME IT'S JUST NOT FUN ESPECIALLY IF I'M ACTIVE OR SOMETHING I PUT MY CHIN DOWN THAT MIGHT HAPPEN TO ME MY TISSUES WERE WEAKENED CHEMOTHERAPY 
10220038 WEAKENS YOUR TISSUES FOR YEARS AND YEARS TO COME AND I WAS INSTALLING A AIR CONDITIONER THIS LAST SUMMER I WAS HAVING TWENTY FIVE 
10220039 POUND AIR CONDITIONER I WASN'T ASKING FOR HELP LIKE I SHOULD HAVE AND A HEAVY DUTY MOUNT I BOUGHT FROM A LOCAL HOME STORE AND I WAS INSTALLING IT AND THE MOUNT BROKE AND TRY TO 
10220040 CATCH THE AIR CONDITIONER WITH ONE HAND AND IT TORE THREE MUSCLES RUNNING OFF MY SHOULDER AND HAD TO HAVE SURGERY FOR THAT MATTER OF FACT ON THE LAST VIDEOS YOU CAN PROBABLY SEE MY BRACE AND I DIDN'T SAY MUCH ABOUT IT AT THE TIME 
10220041 BUT SO YOUR TISSUES WERE WEAKENED PERMANENTLY AND IT HAD A BIG EFFECT ON ME I HAVE SOMETHING CALLED INTERMITTENT PARESTHESIAS AND THE LEFT SIDE OF MY FACE IF I TURN MY HEAD TO THE LEFT FOR 
10220042 VERY LONG AT ALL THE ENTIRE SIDE OF MY FACE AND NECK TINGLES IT'S KIND OF PAINFUL TINKLING IT BECOMES A NUMB AND IT HURTS SO I DON'T TURN LEFT VERY MUCH SO I STILL 
10220043 DO AND WE'LL TALK ABOUT THAT IN A SECOND BUT ONE OF THE BIGGEST THINGS LATELY THAT HAS HAPPENED PROBABLY THE LAST SIX MONTHS IS A CONDITION CALLED CERVICAL DYSTONIA 
10220044 OR SPASMODIC TORTICOLLIS AND SO YOU MIGHT SEE IT BUT ONCE IN A WHILE WHO ACTUALLY HAVE THE MUSCLES TIGHTEN BECAUSE IT HAS AN ANGLE MINE WANTS TO DO THAT BUT I FIGHT IT 
10220045 AND SO MY MUSCLES ARE CONSTANTLY IN BATTLE THE ANTAGONIST ARE FIGHTING BACK AND FORTH TO KEEP MY NEXT STREET BUT THEY SPASM CONSTANTLY YOU'LL SEE MY MUSCLES JUST POP UP REALLY HARD IN 
10220046 BACK I'VE TRIED THREE ROUNDS OF OF HAVING BOTOX DONE MY NECK AND IT'S A CRAZY EXPENSIVE PROCESS 
10220047 AND IT WEAKENS THE MUSCLE AND DOESN'T ALLOW IT TO FUNCTION AS WELL SO FOR ME THAT MAKES ME NERVOUS I DON'T WANT TO HAVE A WEAK MUSCLES IN MY NECK EXTRA IF I TRIP OR CURB OR SOMETHING I CAN'T SUPPORT MYSELF SO 
10220048 ANYWAY THAT'S WITH THE WEIRD PART IS IS I KNOW YOU CAN'T HAVE THIS BUT IF I HAVE PARKINSON'S IN MY NECK SOMETIMES BECAUSE I'LL GET THESE THESE KIND OF BOBBING 
10220049 MOTIONS WHERE IT'S A RHYTHMIC TREMOR I AS I CAN'T I CAN'T HELP US I PUT MY FINGER IN THERE I'LL BEAT THE MUSCLE UP AND DOES THAT THAT RHYTHMIC PIECE IS VERY ODD 
10220050 BUT AGAIN SIDE EFFECT OF ALL THE TREATMENTS I HAVE NERVES TO GO THROUGH SCAR TISSUE AND ALL THAT MOVEMENT IS AFFECTING THE NECK AS WELL ANYWAY THERE'S MORE PROBLEMS BUT YOU GET THE 
10220051 IDEA SO YOU'RE GONNA HAVE SIDE EFFECTS FROM THAT BUT AGAIN I'M ALIVE I USED TO MAKE THIS VIDEO USED TO TALK TO YOU AND ENCOURAGE PEOPLE SO IT'S IT'S GOOD THEN PEOPLE ASK ME TO SAY YOU KNOW HOW YOU DOING 
10220052 I SMIRK IT'S LIKE SHOULD I COMPLAIN WELL NO IT'S NOT WORTH IT BECAUSE I RATHER TALK ABOUT THE POSITIVE THINGS THAT ARE GOING ON IN MY LIFE 
10220053 FOR THOSE WHO'VE HAD RADIATION AS PART OF YOUR TREATMENT IF YOU'VE HAD HEMIGLOSSECTOMY YOU'VE HAD RADIATION I HAVE SOME EXTRA IDEAS FOR YOU THINGS I THINK ARE IMPORTANT I'VE LEARNED 
10220054 I'VE MET PEOPLE WHO'VE HAD THIS HAVE NOT HAD GOOD ORAL CARE AND IT'S LOST THEIR TEETH OVER THE TEETH OF ROTTING OR FALLING APART SO I WAS BLESSED I 
10220055 HAD SOMEONE EARLY ON A FRIEND I WAS A DENTAL HYGIENIST AND SHE WAS ABLE TO GET ME SOMETHING CALLED A FLUORIDE VARNISH AND I WAS ABLE TO PUT THAT ON MY TEETH ON A FAIRLY REGULAR BASIS IS SOMETHING THAT 
10220056 A DENTIST WOULD DO WITH YOU TWICE A YEAR AS YOU'RE CLEANING PERHAPS BUT WITH THAT FLUORIDE VARNISH DOES IS IT ALLOWS YOU TO ACTUALLY HAVE IT KIND OF SLOWS THE 
10220057 DEMINERALIZATION OF YOUR TEETH IT HELPS TO STRENGTHEN THOSE AND ALSO HELPS TO AVOID DECAY OF THE TEETH AS WELL SO YEAH YOU KNOW FLUORIDE IS A POISON BUT THE SAME TIME AS 
10220058 USED PROPERLY CAN ACTUALLY HELP YOU QUITE A BIT I HAVE MY TEETH CLEAN FOUR TIMES A YEAR AND IT'S TWICE AS OFTEN IS RECOMMENDED BUT WHEN YOU HAVE LACK OF SALIVA AND 
10220059 I HAVE NO SALIVA FUNCTION IN MY MOUTH AT ALL IT ACTUALLY BAD FOR YOUR TEETH AND BED FOR YOUR MOUTH HYGIENE SO I HAVEN'T SEEN FOUR TIMES A YEAR MAKING SURE THAT WAS TAKEN CARE OF PROPERLY 
10220060 AFTER EVERY TIME I EAT ANY FOOD AT ALL I USE A WATER PICK OR OTHER TYPE OF PRODUCTS LIKE THAT I'VE THREE OF THEM ACTUALLY ONE FOR TRAVEL 
10220061 AND ONE IN THE KITCHEN ONE LIKE MY BATHROOM I'VE GONE EVERYWHERE I USE A WATER PICK TO CLEAN THE MOUTH OUT I USE A FLOSSERS STICK I'M FLOSSING THREE OR FOUR TIMES A DAY TO KEEP THAT STUFF OUT 
10220062 OF MY TEETH SO IT CAN'T FORM OF CAVITIES I'M SOMETHING YOU DON'T HAVE A TON MUCH TONGUE FUNCTION YOU CAN'T CLEAN FOOD I'VE YOUR TEETH ANYWAYS SO IT'S WORTHWHILE TO HAVE US IN YOUR IN YOUR POCKET A 
10220063 ANOTHER THING TO THINK ABOUT IS TALKING TO MAYBE A NUTRITIONIST OR TALKING TO SOMEBODY AT A HEALTH FOOD STORE BUT YOU WANT TO GET QUALITY NUTRITION TO BE ABLE TO HAVE 
10220064 YOUR BODY THE ABILITY TO HAVE THE OSTEOBLAST AND SUCH TO BUILD AND AND SUPPORT YOUR BONE FUNCTION AND BONE GROWTH SO YOU ARE LOOK AT HAVING 
10220065 HIGH QUALITY CALCIUMS AND SOMEBODY ABSORB AS WELL IN YOUR SYSTEM YOU WANT TO HAVE SOMETHING TO MAGNESIUM YOU WANT TO HAVE VITAMINS A C AND D ALL THOSE 
10220066 HELP WITH BONES AS WELL AND C'S JUST GOOD FROM A STANDPOINT OF YOU KNOW COLD AND FLU SEASON AND SUCH BUT BUT A BIGGER ONE TOO IS GOING TO BE JUST WORKING A STARCH ISSUE 
10220067 I HAVE A LOT OF STARCH ISSUE IN MY NECK IT'S VERY HARD IF I PULLED UP BUT I CAN ACTUALLY GRIND ON THIS THING AND EVERY DAY I'M DOING WORK ON THIS I'M ACTUALLY MAKING A VIDEO 
10220068 SOON SHOWING YOU SOME SOME SELF CARE AND HOW TO BREAK UP A SCAR TISSUE AND GET MORE RANGE OF MOTION BUT ANYWAY I HOPE THIS VIDEO HAS BEEN HELPFUL 
10220069 I HOPE FOR THOSE WHO'VE HAD THE PAST HEMIGLOSSECTOMY OR PEOPLE WHO WERE FEARFUL FOR FRIENDS AND FAMILY WHO ARE GONNA HAVE ONE OR HAD ONE IT'S GONNA BE OKAY IT'S NOT 
10220070 IT'S NOT FUN IT'S DESTRUCTIVE BUT AT THE SAME TIME AS IT GAVE ME A SECOND CHANCE ON LIFE AND IF I HADN'T HAD THIS DONE I WOULD HAVE BEEN DEAD IN TWO THOUSAND THIRTEEN AND HERE WE ARE 
10220071 TWO THOUSAND EIGHTEEN FIVE YEARS AND A COUPLE DAYS LATER I'M STILL AROUND SO THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR WATCHING AND SEND ME YOUR EMAIL SAYS YOU HAVE BEEN IF YOU HAVE ANY QUESTIONS A 
10220072 I TRY TO GET BACK TO YOU AS MUCH AS I CAN BUT 
10230001 ALL RIGHT WELL HI EVERYONE THIS IS VERY VERY DIFFICULT FOR ME TO DO I DEBATED IT FOR A LONG TIME 
10230002 DON'T WORRY I DO A FOLLOW UP VIDEO VIA PRIOR TO THE VIDEO WROTE I RECEIVE THE PHYSICAL MANIFESTATION MY HUMAN 
10230003 AND SO BE NICE TO ME THE MAIN REASON WHY I DO THIS VIDEO IT IS JUST BECAUSE HOW BAD SYMPTOMS ACTUALLY ARE BUT THE MORE I START THINKING ABOUT IT 
10230004 I HAVE NO DOUBT IN MY MIND ALL OF THIS IS GOING TO BE BEHIND ME AT SOME POINT IN THE NEAR FUTURE AND I WANT PEOPLE TO BE ONE HUNDRED PERCENT 
10230005 SURE THAT IT WAS ALL GOD AND LAST TIME I MADE THE VIDEO BACK IN OCTOBER IT'S MUCH CLOSER SO I HAVE NOT YEAH 
10230006 I SPOKE SO MUCH FEAR MY TONGUE WAS SO MUCH SMALLER AND MY SYMPTOMS HAVE NOT PROGRESSED AS BAD AS THEY HAVE TODAY SO I 
10230007 WANTED PEOPLE TO SEE HOW MUCH I WAS REALLY HEALED FROM TO HELP MY TESTIMONY 
10230008 I'M SORRY FOR SPITTING IN A CUP I'VE HAD SOME DEVELOPMENTS WITH ROW STEP 
10230009 BEING ON MY NECK BUT IF YOU SEE HERE 
10230010 IT'S NOT BUT IT'S A ROD RIGHT THERE RIGHT HERE OH MY GOD I THOUGHT I'LL GET HIT 
10230011 MY SON I HAD SOMEONE HIT MY MOUTH WITH HIS HIM HIT DOGS BECAUSE RUGS AND IT SENT SO MUCH PAIN THROUGHOUT 
10230012 MY HEAD MY MOUTH PROHIBITIVE SO THAT'S ONE THING THAT DEVELOPED THE OTHER THING THAT HAVE DEVELOPED WAS 
10230013 THE SIZE OF MY TONGUE DESTROYING REALLY REALLY RUINED MY TIME SO MUCH SO YOU HAVE BITE MARKS 
10230014 ON MY TONGUE HERE'S MY TEETH HAVE NO WAY OF COMING TO EAT ANYMORE IT JUST SAYS ON MY ACTUAL TIP OF MY TONGUE 
10230015 AND THE ORIGINAL TUMOR GIVES IT THE BAT THE SMILING IS SO BIG THE FRONT OF 
10230016 MY TONGUE THAT IT'S ALMOST FRUSS TO THAT TUMOR NOW 
10230017 AND OF COURSE MY SPEECH IT'S A MENTION THAT HAD JUST GOTTEN WORSE AND WORSE AS JUST MINE THE TUMOUR INCREASED 
10230018 IMPORTANT HOW IT'S NOT DESTROYED BUT I'M JUST AS CONFIDENT I KNOW I'M MORE CONFIDENT 
10230019 NOW THAN I WAS IN OCTOBER THAT THIS IS MINE AND WHAT HAS HAPPENED IS THAT EVERY SINGLE DAY 
10230020 I'VE BEEN TIMING THE WOUND I'VE TIMING THE PRAYER I'VE BEEN TRYING LISTEN TO TESTIMONIES PEOPLE HAVE DONE THIS AND BEEN THROUGH 
10230021 THIS AND COME OUT VICTORIOUS AND MY HEART HAS JUST CONTINUED TO OPEN UP 
10230022 TO RECEIVE THE HEALING THAT WAS MINE ALL ALONG THERE WAS NEVER EVER THE ONE HOLDING ME BACK IT WAS NEVER THE ONE 
10230023 HOLDING MY HEALING AND NOT LOSING TO ME IT WAS ALREADY DONE TWO THOUSAND YEARS AGO ON A HEART ONE HUNDRED PERCENT COMPLETED 
10230024 AND IT WAS JUST UP TO ME TO BREATHE WITHOUT DYING WITH NO ABILITIES AND IT'S HAVE TAKEN SO MUCH TIME FOR ME TO 
10230025 RENEW MY MIND AND IN MY HEART TO BE OPEN TO RECEIVE THE FOOD TO RECEIVE 
10230026 THE HEALING AND WHAT I THOUGHT HAS HAPPENED OVER THE LAST NINE MONTHS IS THAT LAYER BY LAYER UNBELIEF 
10230027 AND DOUBT HAS TURNED OF AND YOU KNOW I THOUGHT I WAS BELIEVING A HUNDRED PERCENT BETTER OCTOBER BUT THE WORLD IS TRUE AND IT SAYS BELIEVING 
10230028 YOU SHALL RECEIVE WHAT SORT OF THINGS IS DEMANDING PRAYER YOU ACTUALLY PLAY WHICH MEANS AMERICA WHICH IS ALWAYS YOU OVERSEE THIS IS BELIEVED 
10230029 PARAPHRASED SO IF I HAVEN'T RECEIVED A MANIFESTATION IT'S DUE TO UNBELIEF OF MY HEART PERIOD 
10230030 SO I WAS IN MUCH MORE DETAIL ON ALL OF IT WHEN I CAN ACTUALLY SPEAK MORE CLEARLY YOU CAN HEAR ME BETTER BUT I HAVE A SO 
10230031 SUPPRESSION OF ROCK DE IMAGES SO THAT MEANT TO FULL MANIFESTATION OF THE HEALING TAKE PLACE AS MY HEART 
10230032 HAD BECOME THOROUGHLY PERSUADED AND THE DARK UNBELIEF IF HAS BEEN TAKING OFF WHEREBY AS A MANIFESTATION COMES AND THE HEALING COMES 
10230033 YOU WILL SEE WHAT ACTUALLY I CAME FROM AND I BELIEVE IT'S GONNA TAKE SO MUCH SKEPTICISM OUT OF THE PICTURE 
10230034 SO MUCH DOUBT SO MUCH UNBELIEF YOU CANNOT DENY A MIRACLE YOU CANNOT DENY A MIRACLE SO I JUST HAD A LOT BETTER SEASON

10240006 THIS IS ALL GOING TO BE GONE IN SUCH A QUICK AMOUNT OF TIME THAT I FELT SUCH AN URGENCY TO DO THIS VIDEO

10240012 A LITTLE BIT OF SEE AS WELL AS YOU CAN HAVE IN A BRIGHTLY LIT BATHROOM BUT IT SHOULD HELP AT LEAST ALL RIGHT 
10240013 A BIG LUMP RIGHT THERE ON THE TOP IS WHERE THE TUMOR GREW TO SO OBVIOUSLY YOUR TONGUE SHOULD BE 
10240014 FAST AND COMPLETELY PINK 
10240015 ON TOP IS ALSO PART OF THE WHERE THE TUMOR HAS GROWN OR I GUESS WHAT IT LOOKS LIKE AND THEN UNDERNEATH 
10240016 I SEE MY NORMAL 
10240017 I DON'T KNOW WHETHER YOU CAN SEE IT BUT THAT WAY WHEN I'M SHARING MY TESTIMONY SOMEDAY 
10240018 I KNOW I'M GONNA BE SHARING IT WITH MILLIONS AND MILLIONS OF PEOPLE AND SO MANY PEOPLE ARE GONNA BE SET FREE BY SEEING THE TRUTH HERE OF GOD'S WORLD COME ALIVE 
10240019 I'LL BE SHARING MORE OF MY TESTIMONY IN FULL-LENGTH WHEN I'M SHARING IT SOMEDAY SOON WANT SOME BEEN COMPLETELY RESTORED 
10240020 BUT I DECIDED SO IMPORTANT FOR PEOPLE HAVE SEEN ME IN THIS REAL STATE THIS TRANSPARENT STATE TO SEE 
10240021 HOW REAL WAS HOW BAD IT WAS THE PAIN IS ABSOLUTELY HAS BEEN JUST SEVERE I'M TALKING TEN OUT OF TEN PAIN ATTACKS 
10240022 I'VE HAD MULTIPLE TIMES A DAY LIKE SCREAMING I CAN BARELY EVEN CONTAIN MYSELF AS IF YOU WERE 
10240023 TEN CENTIMETERS DILATED ABOUT ME PUSH THE BABY OUT BUT WORSE I'VE BEEN TAKING IBUPROFEN EVERY ONE AND A HALF HOURS OR TWO HOURS 
10240024 TYLENOL AS WELL AROUND THE CLOCK JUST EVEN GET THEM REALIZE THEY WERE VERY WEAK I DON'T KNOW 
10240025 I JUST HIDE THROUGH THIS VIDEO BECAUSE I AM SO ENTIRELY CONFIDENT THAT GOD'S WORD IS TRUE IT WILL NOT 
10240026 RETURN VOID I KNOW THAT I'M ALREADY HEALED AND THAT'S SOMETHING I'LL GO INTO AS I'M SHARING MY TESTIMONY SOMEDAY BUT IT WAS SOMETHING 
10240027 I JUST CAME TO THE REVELATION THAT I'M NOT APPROXIMATELY THREE MONTHS OR SO AND THIS WOULD BE THE ANDREW WILLNETT 
10240028 MINISTRY AND THEN JUST SOME MORE REVELATIONS IN MY WARD AND SOME BOOKS SUCH AS HEALING EXCEPT BHAKTI LOST ONE 
10240029 AM I'M ARTIS HEALER AND THE FROST RIGHT NOW AND THANK SUBSCRIBE IT COULDN'T LOSE IT FALLING BUT IT'S TRUE USUALLY I'M SUITED IN HEAVENLY PLACES 
10240030 FAR ABOVE ALL POWER UP AND SUPPLIER EVERY NAMELESS NAME THAT INCLUDES THE NAMELESS CANCER AND THIS TUMOR STARTED ON MY TONGUE 
10240031 I WOULD HAVE A PAIN IN MY EAR MY NECK RIGHT HERE AS WELL MY JAW WHICH TELL ME I STARTED MY TONGUE IS THE WORK OF THE DEVIL 
10240032 HE COMES TO KILL STEAL AND DESTROY BUT CHRIST CAME WE GIVE UP ON ICE AND I KNOW MY INHERITANCE I KNOW 
10240033 THAT JESUS PAID FOR MY HEALING ON THE ON THE CROSS IT'S PART OF MY ATONEMENT PACKAGE IT'S PART OF WHAT HE DID IN THE ATONEMENT IT'S PART OF MY BENEFIT PACKAGE PSALM 
10240034 ONE HUNDRED THREE HE FORGIVES ALL MY SINS AND HEALS ALL MY DISEASES IT ALSO SAYS IN MATTHEW EIGHT SEVENTEEN THAT AFTER HE HEALED HE 
10240035 SAID EVERYONE EVERYONE SAYS THAT'S DOING WHAT WAS SPOKEN BY THE PROPHET ISAIAH THAT HE TOOK OUR SICKNESSES AND CARRIED AWAY OUR PAIN 
10240036 AND ISAIAH IT IT SPEAKS UP THAT AS WELL THAT MATTHEW IS REFERRING TO SO I'VE NO DOUBT ABSOLUTELY ZERO DOUBT IN MY MIND 
10240037 THAT I'M ALREADY YOU KNOW PERSECUTORS WHO TRANSFER WORK SAYS BY WHOSE STRIPES YOU WERE HEALED AND I USED TO QUOTE THIS OVER AND OVER AND OVER AND FOR YEARS 
10240038 AFTER FINDING OUT THE DIAGNOSIS BUT YOU KNOW IT DOESN'T DO ANY GOOD IF IT'S NOT MIXED WITH REAL FAITH YOU CAN'T QUOTE IT ON AND ON AND EXPECT THAT THAT FOR YOUR MIRACLE COMES FROM IT HAS TO COME FROM A DEEP 
10240039 KNOWING INSIDE THAT WE REALLY ARE HEALED AND SOMETIME THAT'S A PROCESS AND FOR ME IT'S A PROCESS BUT I HAD SEVERAL PEOPLE ARE UP TO THAT HAVE BEEN DOWN THIS ROAD MIGHT TEXT 
10240040 I'D BE THE ENGINE WILL MENTION JERRY BASING YOUR GO STREAM ALL THESE PEOPLE AND OTHERS COUNTLESS MORE OUT THERE 
10240041 OBTAIN RECEIVES THE HUMAN HAD ALREADY BEEN PROVIDED AND PAID FOR BECAUSE THEY KNEW THAT WE WERE HEROES AND THEY REFUSED TO LET GO OF THEIR 
10240042 INHERITANCE AND WHAT WAS WHAT WAS RIGHTFULLY THEIRS THEY REFUSED LIKE THE DEVIL TAKE WHAT WAS THEIRS AND THAT TIME THE POINT WHEN I'VE FINALLY COME TO THAT I KNOW HEALING HIS MIND 
10240043 AND I WAS A CHILDREN'S BRAIN AND IT WAS ALREADY PROVIDED ITS ARE YOU THERE IT'S REALLY ARE THERE IN MY SPIRIT MAN AND IT JUST TOOK A LONG TIME FOR ME TO RENEW MY MIND 
10240044 ENOUGH TO GET TO THE POINT WHERE I HAD NO DOUBT ZERO DOUBT ZERO UNBELIEF THAT GOD'S WORD IS TRUE AND WILL NOT RETURN VOID AND I THINK 
10240045 IT'S A PUN GET INTO THAT POINT WHERE SYMPTOMS LIKE THEIR PEAK THE ABSOLUTE WORST POINT THEY HAVE BEEN AT WHERE I WOULD SAY OKAY TIME 
10240046 DOESN'T CHANGE THE WORD AND I HAD AT THAT POINT WAS SO FULLY PERSUADED BY HIS WORD THAT SYMPTOMS NO MATTER HOW BAD THEIR WORK DID NOT MAKE ME 
10240047 DOUBT HIS LORD HIS WORK IT'S THE ONLY THING AND IT'S TRUE AND OUR PHYSICAL SENSES ARE NOT 
10240048 TRUE THERE OF THIS NATURAL PHYSICAL REALM AND I'M NOT ON THIS REALM ANYMORE WHEN I WAS GOING AGAIN I WAS SITTING IN HEAVENLY PLACES AND THAT IS WHERE I AM FROM I AM FROM THAT'S MY SPIRIT THAT'S MY SPIRIT 
10240049 DAYS AND THAT'S WHERE I OPERATE FROM OPERATE FROM THAT SPIRIT REALM DOWN TO THE PHYSICAL AND I'VE LEARNED EVEN THOUGH THE PAIN HAS BEEN SO ABSOLUTELY HORRENDOUS 
10240050 I'M NOT GONNA SAY IT'S BEEN EASY IT'S BEEN HORRIBLE BUT I'VE RUN THAT'S NOT WHO I AM IT'S NOT WHO I AM IT'S NOT THE TRUTH THE TRUTH IS THAT I AM HEALED YOU KNOW TEH TRUTH 
10240051 IS THAT EXACT COMING TO ALIGN IT WITH THAT TRUTH AND AS MY WORLD ALIGNS WITH THAT TRUTH OF THE WORD OF GOD THAT I AM ALREADY HEALED 
10240052 I'M BELIEVING ONE DAY I'M NO LONGER A DOUPLE MINDED MAN UNSTABLE IN ALL MY WAYS THAT IS WHEN THE PHYSICAL REALM RISES UP WITH A SPIRITUAL YOU KNOW ROY A 
10240053 PHYSICAL REALM LORD SHOWED ME ONE TIME IT RECENTLY IT JUST HASN'T CAUGHT UP WHAT'S GOING ON SPIRITUAL THE SPIRITUAL REALM IS SO FAR AHEAD OF THE PHYSICAL REALM AND 
10240054 SO I JUST KNOW I KNOW IT'S ALREADY DONE I KNOW I'M ALREADY HEALED AND IT'S THROUGH COMING TO THIS KNOWING WITH ZERO DOUBT THAT 
10240055 IT WILL MANIFEST I HATED USING THIS WORD MANIFEST BECAUSE IT'S ALL JUDAS DIDN'T LEAVE ANYTHING OUT WHEN WE PLACED IT IN THE CROSS WHEN WE PAY FOR ALL OUR SICKNESSES AND ALL OUR DISEASES AND 
10240056 CLEARLY OUR PAIN HE DIDN'T LEAVE OUT THE MANIFESTATION PART IT IS A COMMON TERM WE USE I'M REALLY AS YOU SAY UNTIL MY PHYSICAL BODY RISE UP OF THE TRUTH THE WORD OF GOD THAT 
10240057 WAS ALREADY DONE IT WAS ALREADY FINISHED AND IT'S IT'S AIMED AT KNOWING THE HOLY SPIRIT THEN QUICKENS MY MORAL BIAS WAS IN THAT COMMENTAR ALIGNMENT THE HOLY SPIRIT 
10240058 IS WHERE WEEKS TO THEN CLICK ON MY WATERLINE SO I HAVE A LITTLE A DEALING I THOUGHT THERE'S SOME URGENCY TO DO IT QUICKLY BECAUSE I KNOW IT'S THAT CLOSE

10240060 THE HOLY SPIRIT CLICKING MY MORAL BODY NOW NOTHING CAN STOP THIS BODY COMING TO ALIGN NEW TRUTH THIS TUMOR SHRINKING AND DISSOLVING RAPIDLY

10260020 YOU DIDN'T HAVE ANY KIND OF METASTASES INTO YOUR LYMPH NODES AT ALL SO YOU DIDN'T HAVE TO DEAL WITH THAT YOU JUST HAD YOUR TONGUE SURGERY ITSELF 
10260021 AND YOU HAVE OPTED TO TAKE WHAT PATH THEN AS FAR AS TREATMENT AFTER THE SURGERY YOU'RE DOING ANYTHING ELSE BESIDES THAT RIGHT SO I HAD A PARTIAL GLOSSECTOMY 
10260022 LAST YEAR AND I THOUGHT OF THE CREATION AND BRACHYTHERAPY AND THEN UNFORTUNATELY I HAVE REOCCURRENCE IN JULY OF 
10260023 2015 AND I HAD TO HAVE THE HEMIGLOSSECTOMY SO AFTER SURGERY YOU KNOW I COULD COULD HAVE ARBITRATION CHEMO 
10260024 BUT BECAUSE MY MARGINS WERE CLEAR AND IT WHAT DO NOT EXPECT MY LYMPH NODESS I DECIDE TO JUST HAVE MY DOCTOR 
10260025 CROSSING MIAMI EVERY MONTH SO I'M PROBABLY SEEING AT LEAST TWO DOCTORS A MONTH AND HAVING A PET SCAN EVERY THREE MONTHS TO HOPE THAT YOU KNOW EVERYTHING WILL BE 
10260026 CLEAR RIGHT SO FAIR MARGINS ARE GOOD MINE WERE CLEAR ALSO BUT THEY WERE VERY VERY THIN AND SO THAT IN COMBINATION WITH HAVING MY LYMPH NODE EXPLODING LIKE A 
10260027 SQUISHED BLUEBERRY MY DOCTOR SAID THAT MADE IT MORE NECESSARY SO TELL ME MORE I'M ON TALK ABOUT THE KIND OF UNDERSTAND HOW THIS AFFECTED YOU YOU GOT THE NEWS 
10260028 THAT YOU HAVE TO GOT THE HEMIGLOSSECTOMY THAT HALF YOUR TONGUE REMOVED HOW DID THAT AFFECT YOU SO MY I HAD GONE TO THE DOCTOR AND GETTING 
10260029 BIOPSY HE THOUGHT SOMETHING HARD ON MY TONGUE AND HE HAD RUSHED YOUR BIOPSY THE FOLLOWING DAY GET A PHONE CALL AS I'M DRIVING HOME 
10260030 AND MY DOCTOR TOLD ME YEAH I HAVE CANCER AGAIN AND I WAS DEVASTATED AND MY INITIAL REACTION WAS NO MORE SURGERY 
10260031 I CAN'T HANDLE A NEW SURGERY CUZ I ALREADY HAD TWO SURGERIES PRIOR AND AFTER THINGS GOING 
10260032 HOME THINK ABOUT CRYING SAYING WHY AGAIN WHY DID IT HAPPEN GETTING I JUST LIKE THAT AND DOING MY RESEARCH YOU KNOW I 
10260033 FOUND YOU ONLINE AND OKAY WELL HE DID IT I COULD DO IT AND HE SOUNDS GREAT YEAH SO YOU WERE MY INSPIRATION TO DO 
10260034 THE SURGERY GREAT OKAY WELL IT'S POSSIBLE I COULD GET THROUGH IT AND GIVE KNOW I HAVE QUALITY OF LIFE BECAUSE I WAS BEING TOLD 
10260035 WHO GOT MY QUALITY OF LIFE WOULD BE VERY DIFFERENT YEAH QUALITY OF LIFE IS AS I TALKED ABOUT THIS EARLIER IT'S KIND OF SUBJECTIVE AS FAR AS WHAT DO YOU WANT WHAT ARE YOUR EXPECTATIONS 
10260036 OF THE FUTURE AND OF COURSE BEING ALIVE IS NICE LOOKING AT WHAT THAT LOOKS LIKE I THINK THE HARDEST PART EMOTIONALLY IS I MEAN YOUR YOUR ELEMENTARY SCHOOL TEACHER 
10260037 RIGHT THESE ALSO SPEAK FOR A LIVING AND TO HAVE SOMEONE TELL YOU THAT YOU'RE TAKING AWAY YOUR ABILITIES AT LEAST SPEAK THE WAY YOU USED TO SPEAK IT'S SCARY MMM OKAY IT'S SO IMPORTANT 
10260038 POINT SPEAKING FOR MY PROFESSION I GO IN EVERY DAY I HAVE TO SPEAK CLEAR SO MY STUDENTS UNDERSTAND ME BY THE WAY MY PRINCIPAL I TOLD MY PRINCIPAL WHAT 
10260039 HAPPENED TO ME AND SHE WAS VERY UNDERSTANDING AND SHE SAID YOU KNOW TAKE THE TIME YOU NEED AND WHEN YOU COME BACK WE'LL FIGURE OUT SOMETHING FOR YOU SO 
10260040 I GOT ME SO OKAY WELL I KNOW I HAVE A PLACE TO GO AFTERWARDS IT MAY NOT BE THE SAME POSITION BUT 
10260041 WE'LL MAKE UP FOR IT SO I AM LOOKING FORWARD TO GOING BACK TO WORK I FEEL LIKE AT THIS POINT HOW I FOUND WHAT I WILL BE ABLE TO DO IT AND FEEL CONFIDENT 
10260042 RIGHT AND THE PRACTICE HAS HAD PEOPLE WHEN YOU KNOW AND PEOPLE CAN SPEAK WHAT'S NORMAL PEOPLE GOING TO KIND OF LISTEN TO YOU BUT WHEN THEY HAVE TO TAKE TIME TO LISTEN TO WHAT YOU'RE SAYING 
10260043 HOW YOU'RE ARTICULATING ENUNCIATING THEY ACTUALLY MIGHT LISTEN BETTER YOU KNOW IT'S A GREAT THING AND IT'S ACTUALLY LISTENED TO YOU MORE SO YOU HAVE TO ACTIVELY LISTEN SO 
10260044 WE HAVE TO CONCENTRATE AND GO HEAR EVERY WORD SO WHAT HAVE YOU FELT HAS BEEN THE MOST HELPFUL FROM YOU'VE HAD FRIENDS AND FAMILY EVERY GREAT HUSBAND WHO'S BEEN

10260050 GO THROUGH THIS I'M JUST BEING THERE BEING AVAILABLE AND YOU KNOW PEOPLE THAT YOU COULD SAY OH I'M SO SORRY YOU'RE GOING THROUGH THIS WHEN YOU'RE GOING THROUGH IT HASN'T HELPED I'M THINKING WHY DOES SOMEONE JUST TO 
10260051 GIVE YOU A HUG TO STOP MY TO BE ABLE TO DO SOMETHING FOR YOU IT'S NICE BUT JUST TO KNOW THAT YOU'RE LOVED AND SUPPORTED AND YOU HAVE SOME OF THE COFFEE NEED SOMETHING YOU MIGHT BE ABLE TO SAY IT

10280001 I KEEP A BLOG CALLED NOT WHAT YOU HAD PLANNED DOT BLOG SPOT DOT COM AND THAT BLOG IS WILL YOU HELP PEOPLE REALIZE HOW BLESSED WE ARE I 
10280002 EVEN THOUGH THEY WERE NOT BEING BLESSED AT ALL THERE ARE THINGS AROUND US OF BLESSES CONSTANTLY BUT THIS VIDEO TODAY IS NOT FOR THOSE PEOPLE THIS VIDEO IS TO HELP PEOPLE WHO HAVE BEEN 
10280003 TOLD IS YOU'RE GOING TO HAVE SIGNIFICANT PIECE OF YOUR TONGUE REMOVED AND THAT DOESN'T COMING YOUR WAY QUICKLY AND I WANT TO ENCOURAGE YOU AND TO HELP 
10280004 YOU REALIZE THAT IT'S SOMETHING INTO THE WORLD BUT I TELL YOU I WAS HAPPY WITH MY STORY I'M NOW TWO MONTHS POST OP I WILL SPARE YOU THE DETAILS OF MY MULTIPLE 
10280005 SURGERIES BUT MY MAIN SURGERY TOOK PLACE WAS TWO MONTHS AGO TODAY IN THAT SURGERY TO REMOVE THE LEFT 
10280006 HALF OF MY TONGUE LITERALLY ACTUALLY SLIGHTLY MORE THAN THE LEFT HALF AND IT TOOK THE LEFT HALF OUT BECAUSE SO MUCH WAS REMOVED IS REPLACED WITH THE SKIN 
10280007 FROM MY FOREARM HE'S HAD A LARGE CHUNK OF SKIN THEY TOOK IT ALL THE WAY DOWN TO THE TENDON A NERVE AS WELL AS THE ARTERY AND VEIN 
10280008 ALL THE WAY DOWN TO MY ELBOW AND THAT PIECE WAS DESIGNED TO BE A FLAP TO REBUILD MY TONGUE TO GIVE IT SOME SUBSTANCE SO MY 
10280009 RIGHT HALF OF MY TONGUE THAT I WAS MOVING AROUND TISSUE MY LEFT HALF IS NOT A MUSCLE MY RIGHT HALF IS DOING DOUBLE DUTY IT LOOKS FAIRLY NORMAL 
10280010 IT'S THE AVERAGE PERSON YOU MAY NOT NOTICE BUT IT'S IT'S IT'S FIXED BUT IN THAT PROCESS THEY DIDN'T GIVE THANK TO MEANING 
10280011 WHO ARE FROM HERE TO HERE I QUARTER OF MY NECK THEY REMOVED IT TO THE LYMPH NODES ON THIS SIDE HE FOUND OUT THAT THE VERY TOP 
10280012 A NODE WAS BURSTING FORWARD WITH CANCER FROM BECAUSE OF THAT I HAD TO GO THROUGH CHEMORADIATION AND THANKFULLY I'M TWO THIRDS AWAY THROUGH THAT THAT PROCESS 
10280013 RIGHT NOW I'VE GOT ELEVEN MORE RADIATION SESSIONS TO GO AND ONE MORE CHEMO THEY'RE PRETTY LARGE DOSES OF CHEMO BUT 
10280014 ANYWAY SO HAVING THAT DONE I'LL ALSO LOOK AT THE TUBE COMING OUT OF MY BELLY I'LL SAVE YOU THAT BUT THEY ARE CALLED A PEG TUBE P. E. G. A PEG 
10280015 THAT ALLOWS ME BE FED WHEN I WOKE UP IN THE HOSPITAL I COULDN'T BREATHE I HAD A TRACHEOTOMY I HAD A BIG APPARATUS HERE 
10280016 AND NOW ALLOWED ME TO COUGH CHOKE BREATHE WHATEVER YOUR CASE WAS AND SO BETWEEN NOW I ONLY HAVE AIR AND THEN FOOD GOING THROUGH THIS TUBE IN MY STOMACH THAT'S HOW I ATE 
10280017 ATE FOR A COUPLE OF WEEKS AND EVENTUALLY AS ABLE TO START GETTING FOOD THROUGH MY THROUGH MY MOUTH OR MAYBE SOME UPDATES ON WHAT'S GOING ON WITH ME 
10280018 AND WHAT TO EXPECT CHEMO PORTION OF THIS IS PRETTY HARD I'M NOT GONNA SAY IT'S EASY IT'S DIFFERENT FOR EVERYBODY THE BIG PIECE OF 
10280019 I'LL GIVE YOU IS WHEN I TELL YOU TO TAKE YOUR ANTI NAUSEA MEDICATIONS STAY ON TOP OF THOSE BECAUSE KEEPING FOOD DOWN CAN BE DIFFICULT AND KEEPING YOUR FOOD DOWN YOU START LOSING WATER 
10280020 AND YOU START FEELING HYDRATED YOUR WHOLE SYSTEM STARTS TO SHUT DOWN SO STAY ON TOP OF THOSE YESTERDAY I SPENT ACTUALLY THE DAY AT THE HOSPITAL WITH I. V. 
10280021 HISTORY THOSE ARE GOING IN ME AGAIN BECAUSE MY SYSTEM STARTED HAVING DIFFICULTIES I AM LOSING MY VOICE RIGHT NOW BECAUSE OF RADIATION I WAS SPEAKING BETTER HERE JUST 
10280022 WEEK AGO BUT THE RADIATION IS BUILDING UP AND BUILDING UP AND IT'S LIKE GETTING A BAD SUNBURN OVER AND OVER OVER THE SAME SPOT IN THAT DESTRUCTION 
10280023 OF TISSUE IN THAT PROCESS HOPEFULLY IT WILL HEAL QUITE A BIT I'M A PUBLIC SPEAKER IF YOU LOOK AT MY VIDEOS YOU CAN SEE ITS LINKS PERHAPS ON MY BLOG 
10280024 AS WELL AS ROBERT B. HAASE H. A. A. S. E. S. E. YOU'LL SEE SOME OTHER VIDEOS I'VE DONE FOR SOME BUSINESSES THAT I OWN BUT I'M PUBLIC SPEAKER I HAVE A RADIO 
10280025 VOICE AT LEAST I HAD ONE SO I WILL ALSO GET THAT BACK BUT THE RADIATION IS DAMAGING TO A NUMBER OF STRUCTURES IS DAMAGING TO YOUR ANTERIOR NECK 
10280026 YOU SEE MY TRACHEOTOMY SCAR RIGHT HERE BUT THAT THAT ANTERIOR PART STARTED TO CINCH UP AND BECOME FIBROSED AND VERY LEATHER 
10280027 LIKE AND SO I TILT MY HEAD BACK YOU CAN SEE THIS I'M GOING TO ROCK MY NECK AND SO THEY GIVE ME SOME EXERCISES TO STRENGTHEN THAT 
10280028 THE THERAPIST AND ME WILL TELL YOU THAT'S FINE BUT WHAT YOU DO IS STRETCH THEM OUT THAT MEANS YOU GONNA PUT SOME FAVORS ON A SHORTENED MUSCLE THEN YOUR HEAD BACK 
10280029 EVERY DAY AND LENGTHEN THOSE TISSUE GET A LENGTH OUT OF THOSE YOU HAVE THE ABILITY TO MOVE THAT CONTRACTION THAT PULLING IS VERY VERY DIFFICULT IT MAKES IT HARD TO SWALLOW 
10280030 EVEN YOU KNOW NORMALLY WE USE SWALLOW YOUR GIVEN ESOPHAGUS AND TRACHEA SORRY TO SHARE THE SAME THROAT AND OF TRACHEA ON TRACHEOTOMIES 
10280031 BREATHING SO WHEN YOU WHEN YOU BREATHE IT GOES THROUGH THE ANTERIOR PIPE WHEN YOU SWALLOW IT COMES UP IT'S OUT OF THE WAY AND ALLOWS THIS EPIGLOTTIS PIECE 
10280032 MATERIAL TO FLOP OVER AND PROTECTS IT AND THE FOOD IS DOWN YOUR YOUR ESOPHAGUS SO NOW WHEN THEY PIERCE A HOLE THROUGH YOUR THROAT THESE 
10280033 MECHANISMS ARE USED TO WORK INDEPENDENTLY ARE NOW STUCK TOGETHER SO WHEN I SWALLOW NOW TO WATCH MY THROAT TAKES A MOMENT JUST A SECOND 
10280034 IT LIFTS A WHOLE THROAT SO IT BECOMES VERY DIFFICULT TO EVEN SWALLOW BECAUSE IT'S MOVING SO MUCH TISSUE AND IT'S AN EXERCISE EACH TIME I SWALLOW 
10280035 IT'S WORK AND SO MAKE SURE YOU KEEP THOSE STRETCHED OUT KEEP THOSE AREAS MOVING AS MUCH AS POSSIBLE DON'T OVERDO IT IF YOU MEASURE THE LYMPH NODES TAKING OUT YOUR OWN 
10280036 CAUSES LYMPHOEDEMA TALK TO YOUR DOCTOR ABOUT IT BUT MAKE SURE YOU ARE STRETCHING THOSE AREAS OUT THAT RADIATION ALSO BESIDES AFFECTING THAT AFFECTS YOUR 
10280037 SALIVARY GLANDS I CONSTANTLY HAVE TEA OR WATER NEARBY I JOKED ABOUT HAVING A BEER HELMET PUT ON 
10280038 I GONNA HAVE THESE TUBES COMING DOWN TO DRINK CONSTANTLY BUT YOUR SALIVA A IS SO IMPORTANT IT'S IMPORTANT FOR YOUR TEETH AS ARGUMENTS ABOUT YOU KNOW 
10280039 SHE'S FOR IT OR NOT BUT YOUR SALIVA IS WHAT KEEPS US HAVING STRONG TEETH AND WHEN THAT STOPS YOUR TEETH STARTS TO GET SOFTER SO YOU 
10280040 DENTIST SHOULD BE MAKING YOU FLUORIDE TRAYS AND YES IT'S POISON IT'S A SMALL AMOUNT BUT LACK OF TEETH AND LACK OF NUTRITION IN YOUR BODY IS EVEN WORSE SO BE 
10280041 CAREFUL AND DO SOME RESEARCH ON THAT BUT YOU PROBABLY WANT TO HAVE SOME GOOD QUALITY TRAYS MADE AND EVERY DAY YOU GUYS TAKE CARE OF YOUR TEETH BECAUSE THEY BECOME SOFTER 
10280042 AND BECOME MORE BRITTLE AND YOU CAN ACTUALLY LOSE YOUR TEETH SO PARTICULARLY DENTAL HYGIENE FROM THAT THROUGH SALIVA EXPANDS WHEN A SUSPECTED PRODUCTION ESPECIALLY I'VE TALKED 
10280043 PEOPLE WHO ACTUALLY HAD TOO MUCH SALIVA MADE AFTERWARDS TOWARDS MUCOSITIS IT WAS EVEN THICKER MORE LIKE GUM YOU KNOW IT'S HARD FOR THEM TO SWALLOW SO 
10280044 IT AFFECTS EVERYONE SLIGHTLY DIFFERENTLY BUT IT DOES DAMAGE YOUR SALIVA AS WELL MY VOICE RIGHT NOW IS HOARSE FROM ACTUALLY 
10280045 BE GROSS BUT THROWING UP YESTERDAY IT STRAINED MY THROAT QUITE A BIT BUT IT'S ALSO BEEN HOARSE ANYWAY MOSTLY FROM THE 
10280046 RADIATION AND THE RADIATION DOES AFFECT THE STRUCTURES IN THERE I HAVE SORES ALL AROUND MY MOUTH ACTUALLY MY TONGUE IS MY LEAST PAINFUL 
10280047 ISSUE RIGHT NOW I'VE GOT SO STITCHES IN THE VERY BACK HOLDING THESE STRUCTURES TOGETHER BUT THERE'S SORES IN THE TISSUES 
10280048 THE MOUTH AND THEY HURT WHEN YOU WAKE UP IN THE NIGHT AND YOUR MOUTH IS DRY AS PAPER SALIVATE A GLASS OF WATERS TO HELP REHYDRATE THEIR MOUTH AND REHYDRATE 
10280049 SORES SO PAIN MEDICATIONS I TAKE RIGHT NOW THIS PROCESS WE FOUND THE BEST WAY IS HAVE A PATCH SO I HAVE A 
10280050 A PATCH TRANSDERMAL PATCH IT GIVES ME SOMETHING SLOWLY A PAIN HERE IS VERY SMALL PAIN MEDICATION BUT IT NEVER GETS BAD 
10280051 AN ADDITIONAL PAIN MEDS YOU CAN TAKE IT ON TOP OF THAT BUT IT GETS PRETTY PAINFUL ESPECIALLY WHEN YOU JUST GOING TO SCORE YOUR MOUTH IMAGINE HAVING MANY SORES YOUR MOUTH SO THAT'S GOING TO BE COMING 
10280052 BE PREPARED FOR THAT AND DON'T BE AFRAID OF TAKING PAYMENT SO IT'S NECESSARY FOR CERTAIN SOUNDS I SAW HER NOT MAKE VERY WELL 
10280053 LIKE K'S EVER HOLD MY G'S I COULD COME AND GO EVEN A MERRY KISS THAT NOISE A PUCKERING SOMETIMES AS A LOSS OF VACUUM AND 
10280054 I CAN'T EVEN MAKE THAT NOISE SO YOUR YOUR SOUNDS THROUGH INFLAMMATION OR COME AND GO INFLAMMATION YOUR THROAT INFLAMMATION YOUR TONGUE ALL THOSE PIECES 
10280055 WERE COMING TO GO AND SO WHEN YOU THINK YOU'VE GOT A CERTAIN AMOUNT OF RECOVERY IT MAY OR MAY NOT BE THERE BECAUSE IT WILL COME AND GO 
10280056 I SHOULD BE DONE ABOUT TWO MORE WEEKS OF THERAPY AND I'M TOLD IT'S GONNA BE ABOUT A MONTH BEFORE ALL THE SORES 
10280057 ARE CHILL AND I START DIVING BACK TOWN THE BIGGEST THING FOR ME HAS BEEN FOOD I BESIDES THE WAY CHEMO MAKES THINGS TASTE LIKE 
10280058 PAPER OR MY FRIEND TASTES CARDBOARD WHEN SHE HAD HERS CHEMO TAKES AWAY FROM YOUR FLAVOR WELL IMAGINE EATING 
10280059 PASTE WITHOUT THE MINTY SMELL I MEAN LITERALLY YOU HAVE FOOD WITH NO FLAVOR IN THE BRAIN OFTEN WOULD GAG BASED ON THAT 
10280060 YOU HAVE FLAVORS TEXTURES AND THOSE KINDS OF THINGS SO IT'S GONNA BE HARD TO EAT THE RADIATION IS SEVERELY SEVERELY 
10280061 REDUCED ALL FLAVOR IN MY MOUTH AND I USED TO BE THE FIRST THING YOU LOSE IS SWEET SO THEY ARE GAIN WEIGHT BY USING ICE CREAM OR KEEP MY WEIGHT ON AND THE DOCTORS WANT YOU 
10280062 TO THEY WANT YOU TO KEEP YOUR WEIGHT ON BECAUSE YOU CAN'T FIGHT CANCER IF YOU'RE LOSING WEIGHT FAST MY BODY IS ACTUALLY DROPPING TO THE FORTY POUNDS THAT'S FOUR 
10280063 ZERO POUNDS SINCE THIS WHOLE ORDEAL STARTED AND IT'S HARD TO FIGHT WHEN YOUR SYSTEMS ARE LOSING THE VERY SUBSTANCE OF LIFE SO 
10280064 I'VE LOST NOW TASTE AND FIRST THING TO GO WITH SWEETS AND LASTLY LOSE THE SALT I WAS PUTTING SALT ON EVERYTHING I PUT SALT ON NOTHING OUT BECAUSE THE SALT 
10280065 BURNS THE SORES IN MY MOUTH SO NOW I USE THE PEG TUBE AND A PEG TUBE I'LL MAKE SURE OVERLAY THE VIDEO OVER THE PEG TUBE LOOKS LIKE 
10280066 DURING THIS VIDEO YOU'RE WATCHING BUT A PEG TOOL IS WHAT WE PUT SYRINGES INTO THAT ALLOWS ME TO SQUEEZE FOOD IN SLOWLY YOU CAN LITERALLY EAT AN ENTIRE MEAL 
10280067 A MATTER OF JUST MOMENTS I MEAN YOU DO THAT OVERWHELMS THE BRAIN DOESN'T WANT TO STAY IN SO MAKE SURE YOU TAKE YOUR TIME WHEN YOU GET THOSE KIND OF FEELINGS I WILL TELL YOU 
10280068 THAT THE HOSPITAL ARE GOING TO TRY TO SELL YOU ON THESE PRE MADE FORMULAS MADE BY VARIOUS COMPANIES I WON'T SLANDER ANY COMPANIES OUT THERE BUT THEY 
10280069 BASICALLY ADULT FORMULAS OF BALANCED NUTRITION I CARE MORE ABOUT MY BODY THAN MOST I WOULD SUPPOSE AND THOSE FORMULAS ARE NOT OKAY FOR ME 
10280070 SO YOU'RE USING A COMBINATION OF REAL FOOD I GET HIGH QUALITY SUPPLEMENT POWDERS HIGH QUALITY AND NEURO REPLACEMENT POWDER I DON'T HAVE 
10280071 ALL THE GARBAGE DON'T USE SUGAR I'M USING HIGH QUALITY STUFF YOU ALSO JUST OPEN UP A CAN OR YOU KNOW SOME KIND OF A 
10280072 SOUP AND PUT THROUGH A VITAMIX OR SOMETHING THAT SORTS OF LIQUIFIES YOUR FOOD WHATEVER YOUR FAMILY'S HAVING THAT DAY WILL TOSS SOME WATER AND TOSS THAT MEAL 
10280073 INTO A VITAMIX PUREE IT UNTIL IT'S TOTALLY LIQUEFIED AND YOU CAN USE THAT TO EAT BUT IF YOU EAT JUST FORMULAS OFTEN PEOPLE GET HEARTBURN 
10280074 IT'S NOT BALANCED NUTRITION OVER TIME YOU WANT TO MIX UP YOUR SYSTEM SO MAKE SURE YOU GOOD NUTRITION AND INVEST IN SOMETHING THAT ALLOWS YOU TO PUREE YOUR FOOD AND LIQUIFY IT 
10280075 I KNOW VITAMIX FOR EXAMPLE ACTUALLY WILL HEAT YOUR SOUP BY THE HIGH SPEED OF THE BLADES SO I'M NOT INVESTING IN VITAMIX I'M GETTING MONEY FROM THEM BUT 
10280076 INVEST IN SOMETHING SUPERIOR IN QUALITY I'VE TOLD THE NINJA IS PRETTY GOOD BUT MAKE SURE IT LIQUEFIES SO SMALL IN FITTING IS THE SMALL DIAMETER OF THE TUBE THAT THEY GIVE YOU 
10280077 YOU SO AGAIN I HOPE THIS HAS HELPFUL FOR YOU THIS IS JUST SOME INSIGHTS INTO WHAT'S GOING TO COME YOU KNOW IT'S NOW 
10280078 THE FIRST WEEK OF DECEMBER TWO THOUSAND THIRTEEN AND I'M TOLD THAT BY MAY OR JUNE I MIGHT GET MOST OF MY FLAVOR BACK ON THE ONE HALF OF MY TONGUE 
10280079 SO EVERYTHING'S CHANGED FLAVOR EVERYTHING THAT USED TO TASTE NORMAL IS DIFFERENT AND I'M LOOKING FORWARD TO HAVING THAT BACK BUT YOU CAN DO THIS 
10280080 DRINK LOTS OF WATER TAKE CARE OF YOUR BODY STRETCH BREATHE I KNOW THAT IT'S NOT THE END OF THE ROAD YOU GET THROUGH THIS SO HAVE ANY QUESTIONS 
10280081 GO TO MY BLOG AND AGAIN NOT WHAT YOU HAD PLANNED DOT BLOG SPOT DOT COM THERE'S AN EMAIL ADDRESS LINK ON THERE FEEL FREE TO EMAIL ME IF YOU NEED TO IF I HAVE A CHANCE 
10280082 TO ANSWER YOUR QUESTIONS AS I GO THROUGH THIS PROCESS I WISH YOU WELL I'M EXCITED FOR YOUR FUTURE YOU HAVE ONE 
10300001 AND LUCKILY I WAS DIAGNOSED AND I WAS STARTED TREATMENT ALMOST IMMEDIATELY THE CHEMOTHERAPY WAS PRETTY GOOD
10300002 THEY'VE COME A LONG WAY NOW SO PEOPLE WORRIED ABOUT IT THEY SHOULDN'T I MEAN THEY HAVE DRUGS NOW YOU DON'T EVEN GET NAUSEAOUS THE TUMOURS ARE COMPLETELY GONE THE DOCTORS CAN'T FIND THEM SO I'M HAPPY
