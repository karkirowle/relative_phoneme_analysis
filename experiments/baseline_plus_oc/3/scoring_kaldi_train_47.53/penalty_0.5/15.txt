10220023 ALTHOUGH IT MAY BE APPARENT LOSS OF  THE FACT THAT OUT TO OTHERS ARE NOT SPEND TIME WITH BECAUSE A SO SO FOCUSED ON WHAT THEY DON'T HAVE ANY MORE IN THAT SO

10220030 BASED ON THINGS THAT VENTURE LAST FIVE YEARS I  YOU MIGHT EXPECT THE THINGS I WASN'T TOLD THAT MIGHT HAPPEN SO  
10220031 FORD LIKE THE NATIVES AGAIN I  THE NEGATIVE SIDE EFFECTS OF ALL THIS STUFF IS BAD NUMBER ONE THING IS ALIVE AND  COMPLAIN AND 
10220032 AND PEOPLE THINK I HAVE ALWAYS PROBLEMS BUT  YOU KNOW SO THE DOWNSIDE OF TREATMENT ISSUE THIS HAS THE WHOLE POINT OF THE TREATMENTS TO EXTEND THAT LIFE OPPORTUNITY 
10220033 SO SIDE EFFECTS LIES ON THE AIR NUMEROUS I ONCE THE OTHER HAND I  NEARLY A DOZEN BUT THE BIGGER ONES THAT HAVE  
10220034 AXA FIRST WAS A SHORT WAS CALLED ORLEANS SIGNED IN MY  GO FOR WALKS  TREATMENT AND PREVENTION MUCH S. AND P. THE SUDDEN SURGE 
10220035 THE PAINFUL SURGE FROM A LOWER BODY I.  HAS BECOME WEEK ALL AT ONCE AND THAT'S SOMETHING THAT CAME SPECIFICALLY BECAUSE I HAVE A  
10220036 SPOTTING I WAS  RADIATION A COMBINATION OF SOME PEOPLE DOES CAUSE  SIGNED AND THUS SHOULD BE AWARE THAT IT'S IT'S NOT

10280006 HALF OF MY TONGUE  TO SLIGHTLY MORE THAN WHAT HAPPENED TO THE LAST HALF HOUR BECAUSE SO MUCH WAS REMOVED AND REPLACED WITH THE SKIN 
10280007 FROM MY FOR  SKIN  DOWNS ATTENDING A NERVE AS WELL AS THE ARTERY IN VAIN 
10280008 ALL RIGHT DOWN TO A NARROW  DESIGNED TO BE FLAT TO REBUILD MY TONGUE  SUBSTANCE SO MY 
10280009 I HAVE MY TONGUE THAT WAS MOVING AROUND TISSUE I  IS NOT MUSCLE I  I LOOK FOR A NORMAL 
10280010 IT'S THE AVERAGE PERSON  ITS FIXED BUT IN THAT PROCESS  
10280011  HERE I  MY NECK TO REMOVE  HE FOUND OUT THAT THE VERY TOP 
10280012 I KNOW IS BURSTING FORM OF CANCER FROM BECAUSE OF THAT I HAD  RADIATION  TO WADE THROUGH THE PROCESS 
10280013 NOW I'VE GOT ELEVEN MORE  CONCESSIONS  I  LARGE DOSES OF  
10280014 I STILL HAVE NOT DONE THE  OF THE TWO  THAT  TO BE

10280016 AND ALLOW THEM TO COUGH CHOKE BRIEF WHATEVER THE CASE WASN'T UNTIL BETWEEN THE  ERA THEM FROM GOING THROUGH THE  
10280017  FOR A COUPLE OF WEEKS  FOOD THROUGH MY  MY MOUTH I  WITH ME 
10280018 MUCH TO EXPECT I  PORTION OF THIS IS  ITS EASY TO   
10280019  YOU TAKE YOUR ANTI  MEDICATION STAY ON TOP OF THE FOOD DOWN CAN BE DIFFICULT AND  DOWN A STARTLING WATER 
10280020   TO SHUT DOWN SO STAY ON TOP OF THOSE I GUESS I SPENT ACTUALLY  THE HOSPITAL

10280022 A WEEK AGO WITH RADIATION IS BUILDING UP IN BUILDING UP AND  AS SOMEONE OVER AND OVER OVER THE SAME SPOT AND THAT  
10280023 THE TISSUE THAT PROCESS HOPEFULLY WILL HAVE QUITE A BIT  SPEAKER IF YOU LOOK AT NIGHT VIDEOS  LINKS PERHAPS SOME MIGHT BLOCK 
10280024 I THOUGHT ROBERT B. HAAS H. A. S. D. I. C. I  DOWN FOR OF SOME BUSINESSES THAT OWN I  I HAVE A RANGE OF

10340048 THE DRUG OUT YEAH I HAD A  P. I. SO FOR THE  PORTION 
10340049 BUT THEY  THE TUBE  UNAWARE THAT  THE NEXT FIVE OR SIX DAYS SMUGGLING 
10340050  TWICE A DAY OR SO MEASURING THE FLOW OF THAT CAME OUT AFTER A FEW DAYS TO THE FOOD IS A CLEAR ENOUGH AND THE VOLUME AND REDUCE ENOUGH 
10340051  OUT SEPTEMBER GETTING CAUGHT MY MOM  BACKUP HOPKINS BALTIMORE AND A MEETING WITH THE 
10340052 NURSE ON HAND TO  A MAJOR THINGS AS M. ONE TARGET IS DONE IT WAS A NOTICEABLE A MILD THEY KNOW

10340054 BY THIS NEW TWO WEEK MARKED THE PLANE HAD GONE DOWN SIGNIFICANTLY SAID THAT THAT WAS FINE WITHIN SEVERAL DAYS BUT 
10340055 THE ENERGY LEVELS AND THE ABILITY TO BE LIKE A WEAK NOTE FOR MORE THAN TWELVE HOURS TO THAT TOOK SEVERAL WEEKS RECOVER IT WAS  DAMAGE 
10340056 BOTH WITH THE  TO ME REDUCING ABILITY TO EAT  THE NEW  TO RECOVER THEN ALSO THE SIZE OF 
10340057 THE DECISION TO END THE SESSION AS TO WHAT YOU WILL GET BETTER 
10340058 THIS TIME I  GO I REMEMBER BEING TENTATIVE SET AFTER SURGERY AND THE LIKE GOING HUNGRY LIKE THE SEOUL 
10340059 GERMANY AND THE  COME OUT I FELT SO MUCH WORSE THAN WHEN I WHEN IT BECAUSE THEY KNOW THE TUMOR IT DOESN'T ACTUALLY DO ANYTHING TO VIEW THIS AS A WHOLE 
10340060  DOESN'T  IMPACT UNTIL ITS  SIZED  IS BRINGING DOWN EVERY  BODY RIGHT  
10340061 BEFORE AND I FELT LIKE TO FIND AND AFTER IT WAS JUST COULDN'T DO ANYTHING FOR BILLY SUMMIT BUT THAT DID IMPROVE SLOWLY 
10340062 WE HAVE DROPPED ABOUT WHAT TENNECO POUNDS IN THE FIRST WEEK  AFTER ABOUT A DAY OR SO AS OF THE DRINKS 
10340063 SOME COOL ROTH AN  HIGH TEMPERATURE WOULD BE AN AWFUL BUT BELIEVES THAT OLDER THAT  THE EYE

10340067 TONY WAS DURING THE FIRST FEW WEEKS AND EVEN TODAY AS A STRANGE AND EVERY TIME AS THE  WILL TELL YOU THERE IS A  
10340068 CLEARING BALANCE FROM THE LEFT AND RIGHT SIDE BY RETAINING I.  HAVE A LITTLE BIT LESS KNOWLEDGE FOR WHERE IT IS MY MOUTH 
10340069 IT'S SURPRISING THAT I  OFTEN BECAUSE THERE'S LESS THAN THEIR TO BITE BUT YEAH 
10340070 I  HOPKINS IN  JUST FOR A COUPLE OF MEETINGS AND TO GIVE ME SOME EXERCISES UNTIL THE  ABILITY CLOSELY BECAUSE OF THE 
10340071 RATHER SMALL AREA THAT WAS REJECTED I HAVE MANY LONG TERM IMPACT OF SPEECH FOR A  ABOUT AS GOOD AS IT USED TO 
10340072 I  THE DIFFERENCE RIGHT BUT THAT C. I. I.  ALSO SEEN A PHYSICAL THERAPY LIST AS A WHOLE 
10340073 I  HAD TO DO THEIR MOST TO REGAIN THE NECK ABILITY AND  
10340074 I'M NOT SURE YOUR REVEAL  FROM THOSE THINGS WAS LIKE THIS IS A RATHER LARGE AN UNEXPECTED CHANGE 
10340075 THEN IT IT CHANGES THE OUTLOOK FOR THEIR OWN RIGHT I THINK THE VALUE AND WHAT YOU CARE ABOUT 
10340076 AND WHAT YOU REALLY NO LONGER TOLERATE ANY KIND OF NONSENSE THE LONGEST TIME ON ONCE YOU'VE COME SO CLOSE TO 
10340077 LOSING EVERYTHING YEAH SO THE PSYCHOLOGICALLY EMOTIONALLY PERSONALLY I'M NOT SURE THAT NEVER GET BACK TO WHAT WAS NORMAL 
10340078 BUT PRETTY SOON THE KIND OF  LAMB NOW AND  THAT PHYSICALLY 
10340079 IT WAS A FEW MONTHS I STILL HAVE  TO DO AFTER SURGERY THE ABSOLUTELY CRITICAL I WOULD NOT KNOW 
10340080 IT MYSELF THE FIRST TWO WEEKS AFTER SURGERY I  ME I ONE OF THEM AND EVERY  TO STOP 
10340081 I'M LUCKY ENOUGH TO LIVE STILL NEARBY WERE GREW UP SO I AND HAVE PARENTS KNOW WHO CARE AND WOULD BE THAT

10340089 ACTON RELIANCE  KNOW THAT TIME TO GET A DIAGNOSIS IS RIGHT BUT THIS IS PROBABLY THE
