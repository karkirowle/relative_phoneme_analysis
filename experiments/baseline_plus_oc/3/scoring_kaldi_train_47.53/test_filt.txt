10050001 I CAN'T TELL YOU HOW BLESSED THAT FEELS TO BE ABLE TO TALK TO YOU TODAY THIS APRIL THIRD TWO THOUSAND FIFTEEN AND EIGHTEEN MONTHS AGO IN OCTOBER THIRD TWO THOUSAND THIRTEEN I'D THE LEFT HALF 
10050002 HALF OF MY TONGUE REMOVED THAT WAS MY THIRTEENTH SURGERY ALTHOUGH I HAD NUMEROUS SURGERIES AT A CASUAL PACE SINCE BEING DIAGNOSED WITH CANCER IN TWO THOUSAND EIGHT SOMETHING HAD CHANGED 
10050003 CANCER HAD MORPHED INTO A FAST-GROWING AGGRESSIVE CANCER IT HAD TO BE REMOVED QUICKLY WITH SAFE MARGINS IN ORDER TO SAVE MY LIFE DURING THE SURGERY IT BECAME APPARENT THAT CANCER CELLS HAVE SPREAD TO MY LYMPH NODES 
10050004 CAUSING ONE TO BURST LIKE A LIKE A SQUISHED BLUEBERRY AT LEAST THATS HOW MANY SURGEONS DESCRIBED IT AFTER THE SURGERY HAD TO HAPPEN IN SPECIAL SIX WEEKS OF HIGH DOSE CHEMO 
10050005 THERAPY AND THIRTY RADIATION SESSIONS WHICH WORK TOGETHER TO DESTROY THE RESIDUAL CANCER IN MY BODY BUT IT ALSO DESTROYED THE WHITE BLOOD CELL COUNT PRETTY MUCH TO UNDETECTABLE LEVELS WHITE BLOOD 
10050006 CELLS WITH SPECIAL ANGRY LITTLE CELLS THAT HELP THE FIGHT TO KEEP YOU WELL IN HINDSIGHT IT WAS A STUPID IDEA BUT I ALWAYS WANTED TO TRAVEL TO CONSUMER ELECTRONICS SHOW IN LAS VEGAS NEVADA SO WITH A FRIEND JUST 
10050007 WEEKS AFTER MY TREATMENT WAS OVER I WENT TO VEGAS I WAS FLYING IN AN AIRPLANE REBREATHING AIR FULL OF BACTERIA AND VIRUSES THEN ABANDONED A VEGAS IT SPENDS A FEW DAYS WITH A HALF A MILLION PEOPLE FROM ALL OVER THE WORLD 
10050008 I CONTINUALLY HAD TO RETURN THE TRUNK OF OUR RENTAL CAR WHERE WAS A BIG SYRINGE TO SQUEEZE ANOTHER CAN OF FORMULA INTO MY ABDOMINAL TUBE AND RUSHED BACK TO FIGHT THE CROWDS TO SEE THE VARIOUS EXHIBITS ON TECHNOLOGY 
10050009 TO MAKE A LONG STORY SHORT AFTER RETURNING FROM MY TRIP I WAS FOUND THE NEXT MORNING UNDER THE COVERAGE REBREATHING MY OWN AIR I WAS IN COMPLETE RIGOR NON RESPONSIVE BARELY BREATHING 
10050010 THE MEDS HAD TO INTUBATE ME AND GET TO ME THE ICU RIGHT AWAY I WOKE UP A DAY AND A HALF LATER BUT TUBES CAME OUT OF MY THROAT A DOZEN BAGS OF A VARIOUS FLUIDS AND ANTIBIOTICS COMING BY IV 
10050011 DRIP THEY HAD FOUND THAT I HAD PNEUMONIA RESPIRATORY FAILURE AND SYSTEMIC SEPSIS ALL AT THE SAME TIME THAT VERY WEEK MY DAUGHTER'S FRIEND HAD A FATHER THAT DIED IN JUST ONE OF THOSE CONDITIONS 
10050012 AND ALL THREE ACTUALLY COULD HAVE KILLED ME I DON'T KNOW ABOUT YOU WHETHER OR NOT YOU'RE A SPIRITUAL OR RELIGIOUS PERSON BUT MY FRIENDS AND FAMILY THEY PRAYED FERVENTLY FOR ME DURING THE WHOLE PERIOD 
10050013 I'M PERSONALLY NOT A RELIGIOUS MAN I DO GIVE JESUS A CREDIT FOR THIS I DON'T DESERVE TO BE ALIVE I BELIEVE I JUST GETTING A SECOND CHANCE A THIRD CHANCE RELIEF IF WE ARE COUNTING 
10050014 AFTER THE EVENTS I'VE GONE THROUGH THERE ARE SEVERAL KEY TAKEAWAYS THAT I'VE LEARNED NUMBER ONE EVERYBODY DIES BUT NOT EVERYBODY TRULY LIVES NUMBER TWO RATHER THAN WALL 
10050015 THE MINDSET OF WHY ME I ASKED WHY NOT ME LIFE HAPPENS TO ALL OF US NUMBER THREE MY PROBLEMS ARE NO BIGGER THAN YOURS IT ALL COMES DOWN TO LIFE TAKING TWISTS AND TURNS AND 
10050016 DIRECTIONS THAT WE NEVER FORESAW BUT THE PAIN WE FEEL IS THE UNEXPECTED OUTCOMES AND THAT FEELING OF LOSS NUMBER FOUR DON'T LET LIFE GET IN THE WAY OF LIVING IF YOU HAVE BREATH PRESS 
10050017 ON NUMBER FIVE AND MOST IMPORTANTLY I'M BLESSED REGARDLESS OF MY CURRENT CIRCUMSTANCES THE GOOD NEWS IS I'VE BEEN ABLE TO RETURN TO DUMA ABOVE THIS PAST YEAR 
10050018 AND THAT'S TEACHING MY ADVANCED INJURY TREATMENT SEMINARS I'VE HAD TO RELEARN TO SPEAK TO FINDING NEW WAYS TO ENUNCIATE WORDS THAT USUALLY USED TO ROLL OFF OF MY TONGUE AND ARTICULATING A THOUGHT 
10050019 FAR DIFFERENT AND SPEAKING CLEARLY ENOUGH FOR PEOPLE TO UNDERSTAND WHAT YOU'RE SAYING YOU KNOW IT'D BE EASY TO LOOK AT WHAT I DON'T HAVE I DON'T HAVE TWO WORKING VOCAL CORDS I JUST HAVE ONE THAT WORKS 
10050020 AND THE OTHER ONE HANGS FLACCID JUST SO JUST ONE IS WORKING TO SUPPORT MY SPEECH I HAVE A DISFIGURED THROAT NECK FROM MY LYMPH NODE REMOVAL HAVE AN INABILITY TO TASTE FOOD WITH THE EXCEPTION OF BITTER AND SOME 
10050021 SOME SALT I HAVE NO SALIVARY GLANDS SO MOIST OF MY MOUTH AS I EITHER AS I SPEAK I HAVE A TONGUE THAT BARELY HE'S EVEN ABLE TO MOVE FOOD FROM SIDE TO SIDE SO I CAN'T EAT LIKE NORMAL PEOPLE DO 
10050022 I HAVE AN INABILITY TO BREATHE PROPERLY WHEN I SLEEP AND HAVE A SPECIAL POSITIVE AIRWAY DEVICE TO PUSH THROUGH AIR SO I CAN I CAN ACTUALLY BREATHE BUT YOU KNOW WHAT AMONGST ALL 
10050023 THOSE THINGS I'M TRULY BLESSED I HAVE A FAMILY AND FRIENDS AND DAUGHTERS WHO LOVE ME I HAVE A GIRLFRIEND THAT LOVES ME I HAVE A THRIVING BUSINESS THAT PAYS THE BILLS AND ALLOWS ME TO LIVE A LIFE THAT 
10050024 I'VE ALWAYS HOPED FOR I GET TO TRAVEL CONSTANTLY TEACHING HEALTH CARE PROVIDERS HOW TO USE THEIR HANDS TO HELP PEOPLE OUT OF PAIN I HAVE TWO HANDS AND TWO OTHER WORKING LEGS AND ALL MY FINGERS AND TOES 
10050025 AND I CAN TASTE COFFEE I WOKE UP THIS MORNING KNOWING THAT I HAD JUST ONE MORE DAY TO MAKE A DIFFERENCE IN THE WORLD TODAY EVERY DAY I LIVE AS A BELLING THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR YOUR 
10050026 PRAYERS THANKS FOR GIVE ME A CHANCE TO UPDATE YOU BYE BYE 
10060001 IT'S BEEN TWENTY FOUR MONTHS SINCE I HAD MY HEMIGLOSSECTOMY HAVING HALF OF MY TONGUE TAKEN OUT AND I GOT TO TELL YOU IT'S BEEN A BUMPY RIDE BUT I'M SO EXCITED ABOUT THE FUTURE I WAS SCARED 
10060002 I WAS WORRIED THAT THERE'S A PUBLIC SPEAKER THAT'S IN HALF OF THIS TIME HOW COULD I POSSIBLY LIVE LET ALONE MAKE A LIVING DOING WHAT I DO BEST AND THAT'S TEACHING SEMINARS AS I TRAVEL THE COUNTRY 
10060003 YOU KNOW BUT CANCER DOES NOT STOP FOR LIFE YOU'D HAVE THINGS COME ALONG IN LIFE AND CANCER MIGHT BE ONE OF THEM IT'S NOT GOING TO STOP YOU THOUGH SO THIS VIDEO IS NOT JUST FOR 
10060004 THOSE FRIENDS I WANT TO THANK FOR SUPPORTING ME OVER THE LAST TWENTY FOUR MONTHS BUT IT'S ALSO THOSE OF YOU OUT THERE WHO ARE RESEARCHING THIS VERY SCARY PROPOSITION BEING TOLD BY YOUR SURGEON 
10060005 YOU MIGHT LOSE AT LEAST HALF OF YOUR TONGUE TO SAVE YOUR LIFE AND I GOT TO TELL YOU I WAS SCARED BUT I'VE COME THROUGH IT I CAN TALK BETTER I CAN ARTICULATE AND ENUNCIATE 
10060006 AND LEARN NEW WAYS TO SPEAK AND I'VE FOUND THAT THE THE FEAR DOES NOT HELP IT SETS YOU BACK SO LOOK AT WHAT YOU 
10060007 HAVE AND BE COUNTING YOUR BLESSINGS NOT THE THINGS THAT YOU DON'T HAVE BUT LOOK WHAT YOU DO HAVE YOU KNOW IT'S BEEN A HARD YEAR FOR ME TOO I'M REBUILDING MY BUSINESS I'M TRYING TO PAY THE BILLS 
10060008 AND EVERY DAY I'M WORRIED ABOUT WHAT'S GONNA HAPPEN NEXT BUT THAT WORRYING DOESN'T HELP THEM A YEAR AGO IF I HAD TOLD YOU THAT ONE OF US WILL BE DEAD MEANING MYSELF 
10060009 FOR MY ASSISTANT CHARITY LIFE FITNESS AND SHE'S A ULTRA MARATHONER SHE'S A VIVACIOUS WOMAN WHO'S FULL OF LIFE AND SHE WAS TRAGICALLY KILLED JUST A COUPLE MONTHS AGO 
10060010 AND JUST THREW ME OFF IT WAS A HORRIBLE SITUATION AND IT WAS A GRAPHIC SITUATION WHERE SHE DIED AND I WANT TO GO INTO THAT BUT 
10060011 YOU KNOW WE WAKE UP IN THE MORNING AND WE EXPECT TO LIVE ANOTHER DAY AND YOU DON'T KNOW YOU'RE GONNA HAVE THAT FOR A GUARANTEE CANCER MAY OR MAY NOT TAKE YOUR LIFE BUT IT'S NOT ABOUT US 
10060012 DYING WE ARE ALL GOING TO DIE QUESTION IS ARE WE ALL GOING TO LIVE WHAT YOU CAN DO WITH THE LIFE THAT YOU HAVE LEFT SO I WANT TO SAY I'M STILL THANKFUL FOR ALL SUPPORTERS I'VE HAD OUT THERE WHO'VE BEEN FOLLOWING THIS 
10060013 PROCESS BUT FOR THOSE OF YOU WATCHING THIS WHO ARE RESEARCHING AND SHOULD YOU HAVE HAVING A GOOD TIME TAKEN OUT SHOULD YOU GO THROUGH THAT PROCESS YOU KNOW YES 
10060014 TO SAVE YOUR LIFE THAT THAT PROCESS MAY TAKE TAKE HALF OF YOUR TONGUE BUT IT'S NOT THE END OF THE WORLD IT'S NOT THE END OF LIFE IT'S NOT THE END OF LIVING WHAT YOU NEED TO DO FROM THIS 
10060015 POINT ON THIS FIGHT IS IS TO SURROUND YOURSELF WITH PEOPLE THAT LOVE YOU AND REALIZE YOU KNOW ARE GONNA LOSE THINGS IN LIFE IT MIGHT BE YOUR HOUSE THAT MIGHT BE YOUR CAR IT MIGHT BE HALF OF YOUR TONGUE BUT YOU STILL HAVE THOSE FRIENDSHIPS

10100015 CAUSED AND I STILL HAVE A PAIN IN THERE SOMETHING LIKE MAYBE SOMEBODY SHOULD WRITE ABOUT IT 
10100016 BECAUSE WHEN YOU GET YOUR RADIATION OVER THERE YOU ARE GOING TO HAVE SORES IN YOUR MOUTH MANY MANY SORES AND THE OTHER PART

10130001 HI I'M ROBERT HAASE AND YOU MAY HAVE KNOWN MY STORY SO FAR BUT IF YOU HAVEN'T I WANT TO GIVE AN UPDATE EIGHT MONTHS AGO 
10130002 ON OCTOBER THIRD TWO THOUSAND THIRTEEN I HAD HALF MY TONGUE REMOVED DUE TO FAST GROWING CANCER AND A TUMOR THAT HAD GOT OUT OF CONTROL THEY TOOK THE LEFT HALF 
10130003 AND THEY REPLACED THAT PART OF MY TONGUE WITH PART OF MY ARM AND YOU KNOW MY ARM SHOWS UP AND THE TONGUE IS PRETTY MUCH HEALED FOR THE MOST PART BUT I'M STRONGER GOING THAT THAT PROCESS OF 
10130004 HEALING I'M STILL EYES WERE PAIN BUT NOWHERE NEAR AS MUCH AS I HAD YOU KNOW I BRUSHED MY TEETH AT NIGHT AND MY GUM STOVE THERE'S STILL BLOOD IN THE SINK IT'S JUST 
10130005 STILL HEALING FROM THAT BUT WHEN THE PROCESS OF TESTING MYSELF THEY WERE DOING A BIOPSY AND TOOK OUT A VERY LARGE 
10130006 CHUNK OF TISSUE AT THE BASE OF MY MOUTH AND THAT IS WHAT'S NOT HEALING WHATSOEVER AND THE REASON WAS IS THE TISSUES IN MY TONGUE DON'T HAVE AS MUCH VASCULARITY 
10130007 IS VERY FEW BLOOD VESSELS BY COMPARISON TO WHAT YOUR TONGUE WOULD BE LIKE AND SO IT WASN'T HEALING SO IN RESPONSE THEY DECIDED TO HYPERBARIC CHAMBER TREATMENTS AND I 
10130008 AT THE END OF NEXT WEEK I'VE HAD FORTY FIVE NINETY MINUTE HYPERBARIC TREATMENTS I WENT FROM HAVING PAIN DAILY WHERE I WAS JUST BREAKING INTO 
10130009 TEARS FROM THE PAIN BEING SO OVERWHELMING TO PRETTY MUCH HAVING VERY FEW PAIN MEDS RIGHT NOW AT ALL ACTUALLY ABOUT THREE PILLS A DAY 
10130010 AND SO I'VE HAD ABOUT EIGHT PERCENT REDUCTION IN PAIN MEDICATIONS AND I'M REALLY REALLY HEALING PRETTY WELL SO THAT'S BEEN PRETTY AMAZING I WAS TOLD BACK AT THE END OF MY CHEMOTHERAPY 
10130011 AND RADIATION BACK IN DECEMBER THAT YOU KNOW MY TASTE IS GONE AT THAT POINT AND I WAS TOLD BY JUNE I HAVE MY TASTE BACK IT'S NOT 
10130012 I GUESS A HUNDRED FIFTY FIVE POUNDS WHICH IS A LEAST I'VE BEEN SINCE JUNIOR HIGH AND NOW I'M NOT GETTING MY WEIGHT BACK AT ALL AND I'M EATING A LOT 
10130013 I HAVE ICE CREAM PRETTY MUCH EVERY DAY I KNOW THOSE OF YOU WHO THINKS IT'S DANGEROUS AND IT CAUSES CANCER I APOLOGIZE TO YOU BUT I HAVE FOOD A LOT OF IT EVERY DAY MORE THAN I THINK 
10130014 I CAN POSSIBLY EAT AND I'M STILL NOT GAINING WEIGHT SO SOMEHOW MY METABOLISM CHANGED AND RESET I DON'T RECOMMEND THIS AS A PROCESS FOR LOSING WEIGHT CANCER DIET BUT THE 
10130015 BUT IT DOES SEEM TO WORK FOR ME BUT THAT DECREASE IN TASTE IS MAKING IT HARD TO EAT IN GENERAL YOU CAN TASTE SOME SALT AND BUT NO SWEETS AT ALL 
10130016 I'M DOING A CAT SCAN NEXT WEEK MY CT SCAN THE CAT SCAN IS GOING TO BE NEXT TUESDAY AND THEY'RE LOOKING FOR CANCER 
10130017 THEY WANT TO SEE THEY'RE GOING BEYOND THE PET SCAN AND LOOKING MORE SPECIFICALLY THROUGHOUT MY UPPER TORSO TO SEE IF THERE'S ANY CANCER IN MY BODY STILL LAST TEST I HAD 
10130018 THE TISSUES ON MY MOUTH SPECIFICALLY WHAT WAS CANCER FREE AND WHICH IS AMAZING SO THAT'S AWESOME BUT THE CAT SCAN DIDN'T GIVE MORE SPECIFIC RESULTS AND SO I'M LOOKING 
10130019 FORWARD TO HEARING TO SAFE FROM THAT BUT I JUST WANT TO THANK ALL MY FRIENDS OUT THERE MY SUPPORTERS AND THOSE WHO FOLLOWED ME THROUGH THIS PROCESS AND I'M JUST I'M SO BLESSED TO HAVE YOU 
10130020 AND YOU KNOW YOU'VE BEEN JUST PUSHING ME AND SUPPORTING ME AND I KNOW IT MANY OF YOU THINK OF YOU'RE ON BEYOND TO CALL BEYOND WHAT I SHOULD BE DOING AND LOOK AT MY WEBSITES AND MY BUSINESS I'VE 
10130021 SCHEDULED MYSELF TEN SEMINARS THIS FALL EVERYTHING FROM WAIKIKI BEACH IN HAWAII TO ATLANTA IN GEORGIA ON THE EAST COAST AND EVERYWHERE 
10130022 BETWEEN AND FROM TEXAS TO THE MIDWEST AND ALL THROUGHOUT WASHINGTON STATE AND IN OREGON I'M JUST EXCITED TO GET BACK TO WORK AND 
10130023 I DON'T SPEAK THE WAY I USED TO THIS IS NOT THE VOICE I WOULD HAVE CHOSEN BUT IT'S THE VOICE THAT I'VE BEEN GIVEN I'M LOOKING FORWARD TO USING THAT VOICE TO MAKE A DIFFERENCE IN MY FIELD AS 
10130024 WELL AS TO ENCOURAGE OTHERS SO THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR YOUR PRAYERS AND SUPPORT AND YOUR LOVE IT'S BEEN AN AMAZING JOURNEY AND IT'S NOT OVER WITH YET SO THANKS FOR SEARCHING WITH ME I'LL TALK TO YOU SOON 
10130025 
10210001 HI EVERYONE I'M JUST HERE TO GIVE YOU MY ONE-YEAR FINDING OUT ABOUT MY TONGUE CANCER UPDATE 
10210002 UM JUST TO LET YOU KNOW WHAT I HAD I HAD TONGUE CANCER THEY CUT IT OUT 
10210003 THERE I CUT MY NECK HERE TO THE BACK AND THEY REMOVED THE LYMPH NODES I TESTED THEM ONE OF THEM THEY SAW METASTASES 
10210004 SO THEY WENT AHEAD AND REMOVED THE OTHER ONES NEXT LEVEL I THINK THE CUTS HERE AND THEY ALSO OPENED THIS AGAIN 
10210005 AND REMOVED THE BOTTOM ONES THERE SO BASICALLY THIS WAS THE FIRST SURGERY IN MY TONGUE AND HERE NO SECOND ONE WAS HERE AGAIN 
10210006 AND DOWN HERE THEN AFTER THAT ABOUT A MONTH LATER I HAD THE CHEMOTHERAPY START WITH CISPLATIN 
10210007 AND THEN THIRTY FIVE SESSIONS MONDAY THROUGH FRIDAY OF THE RADIATION WHICH THEY GOT ME BASICALLY IN THIS 
10210008 AREA I DIDN'T LOSE MY HAIR FROM THE CHEMOTHERAPY BECAUSE AFTER THE FIRST ONE FOR THE FIRST CISPLATIN AND I GOT 
10210009 AFTER THE SECOND ONE SORRY I GOT A LITTLE BIT SICK I THINK IT WAS JUST TOO MUCH MEDICINE IN MY BODY SO THEY WENT AHEAD AND GAVE ME LIKE AN 
10210010 ANTIBODY FOR THE THIRD CHEMOTHERAPY SO I DIDN'T LOSE MY HAIR OR ANYTHING BUT THE CHEMOTHERAPY WASN'T A BIG DEAL BUT THE RADIATION 
10210011 THAT ACTUALLY LOST MY HAIR KIND OF ON A BACK HERE IT'S GROWING BACK NOW A YEAR LATER MAYBE TWO INCHES LONG SO 
10210012 JUST DOWN HERE THIS WHOLE BOTTOM SECTION SLOWLY FELL OUT AS YOU CAN MAYBE HEAR I CAN'T SAY MY SS IS 
10210013 VERY WELL IT KIND OF SOUNDS LIKE AN AS H. AND I HAVE DRY MOUTH SO I CARRY WATER WITH ME 
10210014 EVERYWHERE AND ALSO AND LET'S SEE I CAN'T TASTE FOOD AS MUCH I CAN IT'S COMING BACK SLOWLY BUT IT'S DEFINITELY 
10210015 NOT HUNDRED PERCENT AND I THINK I DON'T THINK IT WILL COME BACK HUNDRED PERCENT BUT WHO KNOWS IT'S ONLY A YEAR OUT WATER TASTES A LITTLE BIT 
10210016 STRANGE TO ME NOW I CAN'T REALLY HAVE A LOT OF VINEGAR ACIDIC FOOD I THINK YOU HAVE PHRASE SYNDROME NOW WHERE 
10210017 BECAUSE I LOST SOME OF THE SALIVARY GLANDS THE RADIATION PRETTY MUCH KILLS ABOUT FORTY PERCENT SO NOW 
10210018 SINCE I DON'T REALLY SALIVATE THAT MUCH I THINK THE NERVES THAT WERE KILLED END UP GOING INTO LIKE YOUR SKIN ON THE SURFACE OF YOUR FACE SO IF I 
10210019 HAVE SOMETHING THAT'S ACIDIC OR SALTY OR SPICY WHICH I CAN'T HAVE TOO MUCH SPICY STUFF LIKE YEAH I USED TO IT 
10210020 BECAUSE THIS IS TOO MUCH PAIN BUT I'LL START TO SWEAT HERE AND ABOVE MY BROW LIKE KETCHUP YEAH IT'S REALLY PAINFUL 
10210021 ANYWAY SEE WHAT ELSE OTHER WAYS IT AFFECTED MY LIFE AND SPEECH SAYING THAT MORE CONSCIOUS ABOUT MY SPEECH SOME PEOPLE SAY 
10210022 THEY DON'T NOTICE IT BUT I NOTICE EVERY TIME I SAY AN S. WORD SOMETIMES MY VOICE CHANGES I THINK MY VOICE 
10210023 IS A LITTLE BIT DEEPER NOW AND SO AND SOMETIMES EVEN IN AFTERNOON IT SOUNDS LIKE I HAVE MORNING VOICE 
10210024 WHAT ELSE I DON'T KNOW HERE MY NECK SINCE I CUT HERE AND THE RADIATION THIS MUSCLE HERE IS 
10210025 AS YOU CAN SEE IT'S KIND OF STICKING OUT IS REALLY TIGHT AND SO I CAN LEAN MY HEAD ABOUT THIS FAR BUT ON THE OTHER SIDE I CAN GO 
10210026 A LOT FURTHER I CAN'T REALLY TURN MY HEAD A LOT BEFORE I FEEL IT START TO PULL BUT DOESN'T REALLY HURT THAT MUCH 
10210027 AND YEAH AND THEN JUST THAT JUST THE TONGUE THE VOLUME IS LESS OVER HERE 
10210028 AND THEN THE RADIATION ALSO MESSES UP YOUR GUMS SO MY TEETH LIKE THE ROOT OF MY TEETH ON BOTH THE TOP AND THE BOTTOM 
10210029 ARE PAINFUL LIKE IF I DRINK SOMETHING THAT'S NOT WRONG A LITTLE BIT WARM AND I CAN FEEL THE PAIN IN MY GUMS AND 
10210030 DOWN ON MY TEETH LIKE ON THE BOTTOM THERE IT'S A LITTLE BIT MORE EXPOSED AND THEN YOU HAVE ALL KINDS OF FUN ENAMEL PROBLEMS AND THINGS 
10210031 LIKE THAT BECAUSE YOU DON'T HAVE THE HEALTHY BACTERIA IN YOUR MOUTH SO YOU HAVE TO KEEP BRUSHING AND FLOSSING AND DOING ALL THAT STUFF THE ORAL CARE INCREASES 
10210032 NEXT THING I'M BASICALLY TRYING TO PREVENT THE CANCER FROM COMING BACK SO MY FAVORITE THING TO DO IS PHYSICAL ACTIVITY I'VE BEEN ON 
10210033 MY BIKE A LOT BUT ALSO I'M WATCHING EVERYTHING THAT GOES IN MY MOUTH AND I FOUND THIS BOOK IS REALLY HELPFUL 
10210034 THIS IS THE GERSON THERAPY IT'S A NATURAL WAY TO CURE CANCER BUT I'M KIND OF USING IT AS A PREVENT THE CANCER FROM RECURRING 
10210035 SO I'M USING THE COFFEE ENAMELS AND THE CARROT APPLE JUICES EVERY DAY AND MAKES ME FEEL PRETTY 
10210036 HEALTHY I'M ALSO IN A PLACE WHERE I HAVE ACCESS TO ISCADOR IT'S ALSO CALLED MISSILE ISCADOR 
10210037 IT'S ALSO CALLED MISTLETOE THERAPY IT'S BASICALLY IT'S MADE BY THE COMPANY WELEDA OR LOOKS LIKE WELEDA 
10210038 BUT IT'S GERMAN THESE ARE THE LOW BACK PILLS AND I OPEN THEM UP AND PUT 
10210039 THOSE INJECT THEM INTO MY BODY MONDAY THROUGH FRIDAY THREE TIMES A WEEK AND AND THAT'S SUPPOSED TO 
10210040 PREVENT THE CANCER FROM COMING BACK AS WELL AS WE HAVE A PART OF THE TREATMENT IS EVERY TWO WEEKS I TAKE A HIGH DOSE OF VITAMIN D BECAUSE EVEN THOUGH I'M IN THE SUNSHINE ALL THE TIME 
10210041 AND I RIDE MY BIKE AND EVERYTHING AND IT'S STILL NOT ENOUGH I GUESS BECAUSE THE UV OR THE EVERYTHING IN ATMOSPHERE IS PREVENTING US FROM REALLY 
10210042 GETTING THAT VITAMIN SO I TAKE IT SO I TAKE A SUPPLEMENT AND THEN I JUST TRIED TO ELIMINATE LIKE I'M ON THE BIKE ALL THE TIME I THINK I WAS DRINKING A LOT FROM 
10210043 PLASTIC BOTTLES AND WE KNOW THE PLASTIC ISN'T GOOD SO I HAVE SINCE SWITCHED OVER I DROPPED THE MONEY AND PAID FOR THE KLEAN KANTEEN 
10210044 STAINLESS STEEL BOTTLE COMES THE CAP OR YOU CAN GET ONE WITHOUT THIS PIECE IT JUST SCREWS ON AND IT 
10210045 FITS INTO MY WATER BOTTLE HOLDER SO STAINLESS STEEL THE WAY TO GO AND WITH EVERYTHING POTS AND PANS GET RID OF ALUMINUM 
10210046 ALUMINUM IS ALSO IN YOUR DEODORANT SO THEY HAVE THESE LITTLE IT'S LIKE A CRYSTAL STICK YOU JUST PUT WATER ON IT AND THIS IS MY DEODORANT 
10210047 I'VE GONE TO ORGANIC HAIR PRODUCTS AND CLEANERS I THINK THEY EVEN THIS CAN BE AT WALMART ORGANICS 
10210048 IT'S JUST LIKE A GEL BUT I HAVE THE SHAMPOO AS WELL ALSO THIS PRODUCT IS THE MOST AMAZING THING ESPECIALLY WHEN YOU'RE IN HOSPITAL AND YOU DON'T GET THE 
10210049 SHOWER EVERY DAY IT IS THE DR. BRONNER'S MAGIC SOAP IT IS AWESOME THIS IS WHAT I USED TO WASH MY HANDS NOW WASH MY FACE UM 
10210050 SINCE I HAVE THE CANCER UP HERE I'M TRYING TO GET RID OF ALL THE PARAFFINS AND ALL THE CHEMICALS AND THINGS THAT I PUT ON MY HEAD ON MY FACE AND 
10210051 I MEAN I DON'T EVEN LIKE TO USE LOTION ANYMORE BECAUSE ALL THAT STUFF IS GOING INTO YOUR SKIN SO I ADVISE THE PEPPER MERC SMELLS GOOD 
10210052 AND WHAT ELSE PROBABLY THAT'S MOSTLY IT I'M JUST TRYING TO 
10210053 WRAP MY HEAD AROUND ALL THIS IT'S COMING UP ON A YEAR AND I HAVE A PET C. T. SCAN IN A FEW WEEKS I WAS ACTUALLY GOING TO WAIT FOR MY ONE-YEAR ANNIVERSARY 
10210054 ON HALLOWEEN TO MAKE THIS VIDEO BUT I COULDN'T MAKE ANY LONGER I REALLY WANTED TO COMMUNICATE THIS WITH THE COMMUNITY OUT THERE WHO ARE YOUNG 
10210055 I'M ONLY THIRTY ONE NOW I WAS DIAGNOSED WHEN I WAS THIRTY AND YOU KNOW IT WAS ONLY A MONTH LATER THAT 
10210056 I WENT AHEAD AND HAD THE SURGERY SO THE KEY THING IS WHEN YOU SEE SOMETHING FUNNY ON YOUR TONGUE IT HURTS JUST LIKE A TYPICAL ULCER 
10210057 AFTER TWO WEEKS YOU NEED TO GO GET IT CHECKED OUT AND A LOT OF DENTISTS DON'T EVEN KNOW WE WON'T KNOW WHAT IT IS THEY'LL JUST SAY IT'S A SORE THEY'LL GIVE YOU A CREAM 
10210058 HAVE THEM DO THE BIOPSY IF IT'S BEEN MORE THAN TWO WEEKS BECAUSE A LOT OF TIMES THEY'LL FIND THAT IT'S CANCEROUS IF IT'S IF IT'S STARTING TO GROW I MEAN MINE WAS ABOUT MMM 
10210059 LIKE THIS ON THE BASE OF MY TONGUE ABOUT ONE AND A HALF CENTIMETERS LONG BY ABOUT ONE CENTIMETER HIGH AND I'M NOT SURE HOW DEEP IT WENT IN BUT 
10210060 THEY THINK THAT DIDN'T REALLY SPREAD JUST TILL THAT ONE LYMPH NODE BUT WHEN THEY FIND IT IN ONE THEY TAKE ALL OF THEM OUT BECAUSE THEY WANT TO BE 
10210061 SAFE AND THEN THEY JUST GIVE ME ALL THE THE HIGHEST LEVEL I GUESS OF RADIATION THAT WOULD KILL ANYTHING ELSE THAT 
10210062 WAS POSSIBLY IN THERE BUT NOW I'M TRYING TO YOU KNOW USE SOME OF THESE ALTERNATIVE METHODS AND PREVENT IT FROM REOCCURRING AND YEAH 
10210063 I THINK THAT'S ALL I HAVE FOR NOW IF YOU HAVE ANY QUESTIONS FEEL FREE TO POST THEM I'LL PROBABLY I'LL PROBABLY PUT SOME LINKS WHERE YOU CAN FIND SOME OF THE PRODUCTS IF YOU'RE NOT SURE AND MOST OF THESE PRODUCTS 
10210064 YOU CAN ALMOST ALL OF THEM YOU CAN GET IN THE UNITED STATES AND SOME OF THEM I HAD MY FAMILY SEND I'M OUT OF THE COUNTRY NOW SO I HAD THEM SEND 
10210065 THEM TO ME I'VE ALSO HAD ONE THING DURING THE RADIATION I HAD A LOT OF PAIN I HAD MUCOSIS AND MY 
10210066 MOUTH WAS COMPLETELY DRY AND I COULDN'T EVEN DRINK WATER I HAD HAD TO GET A FEEDING TUBE MY MOUTH HAD CUTS AND SORES EVERYTHING ALL OVER 
10210067 I DID USE A PRODUCT CALLED DUVAN IT'S JUVEN GO JUVEN DOT COM IT'S SUPPOSED TO HELP 
10210068 YOUR SKIN HEAL QUICKER ESPECIALLY IF YOU HAVE SCARS AND THINGS LIKE THAT SOME PEOPLE DON'T EVEN NOTICE MY SCAR BECAUSE IT'S KIND OF IN THE FOLD OF THE NECK BUT UM 
10210069 BUT I THINK IT ALSO HELPS WITH THE TONGUE SO I FEEL LIKE THAT WAS A REALLY GOOD PRODUCT THAT I USED DURING CHEMO THE RADIATION ALL OF THAT SO THE SOONER YOU 
10210070 CAN GET THAT THE BETTER AND DO IT FOR AS LONG AS YOU CAN AFFORD IT CUZ IT'S NOT CHEAP BUT I THINK IT'S REALLY WORTH IT DOING LET'S JUST GET THE NON-FLAVORED 
10210071 POWDER MIX IT IN WITH YOUR DRINK AND TWO TIMES A DAY AND I THINK IT REALLY HELPED MY TONGUE TO HEAL 
10210072 AND THEN THE MORPHINE LIKE I SAID THE MORPHINE TO HELP I WAS IN THE HOUSE WAS ALSO UM YEAH I WAS LOOKING FOR SOME AMERICAN MEDICAL MARIJUANA 
10210073 HERE WHEN I'M AT BUT I COULDN'T REALLY GET IT BECAUSE I'M IN A DIFFERENT COUNTRY BUT I I WOULD I WAS AT THE POINT WHERE I WAS CONSIDERING DOING THAT BECAUSE I 
10210074 WAS IN SO MUCH PAIN BUT YEAH I GUESS THAT'S ALL I HAVE FOR NOW IF YOU HAVE ANY QUESTIONS UHM FEEL FREE 
10210075 TO ASK ME AND YEAH ALL I CAN SAY IS GOOD LUCK AND SAY YOUR PRAYERS BECAUSE IT'S A TOUGH PROCESS BUT YOU CAN GET THROUGH IT 
10210076 HERE I AM A YEAR LATER AND UHM YEAH STILL EATING STILL ALIVE STILL GOING WE WILL SEE HOW THE SCAN GOES IN 
10210077 IN A WEEK OR TWO BUT GOOD LUCK STAY STRONG AND WELL MAYBE I'LL DO A TWO YEAR UPDATE WILL SEE ALRIGHT SEE YA 
10220001 ON OCTOBER THIRD OF TWO THOUSAND FIFTEEN DOCTOR STEVEN BALES OF VIRGINIA MASON HOSPITAL IN SEATTLE WASHINGTON REMOVED HALF OF MY TONGUE THE LEFT HALF THE PROCEDURE CALLED 
10220002 A HEMIGLOSSECTOMY AND I'M HAPPY TO REPORT THAT FIVE YEARS AND TWO DAYS LATER I AM STILL DANCING WITH NED THEY SAYING NO EVIDENCE OF DISEASE 
10220003 AND I'M STILL CANCER-FREE AND SO I JUST WANT REPORT THAT OUT SO YOU ALL UP TO SPEED IT'S WHAT'S HAPPENING WITH MY MY PROCESS IF YOU FOLLOWED MY STORY YOU'LL KNOW THAT WAS FIRST DIAGNOSED 
10220004 WITH SQUAMOUS CELL CARCINOMA OR TONGUE CANCER IN TWO THOUSAND EIGHT DOCTOR CARL MYERS I REMEMBER THE MORNING HE CALLED ME ON SEPTEMBER TWENTY NINTH AND HE SAID THE 
10220005 BOB I'VE GOT I'VE GOT HARD NEWS HE SAID YOU'VE UH YOU'VE BEEN DIAGNOSED WITH CANCER IT IS INDEED CANCER YOU'VE GOT AND MY HEART SANK AT THAT MOMENT 
10220006 I WAS THINKING LIKE WOW DRIVING TO HAVE A FUTURE IF YOU HAD TOLD ME YOU KNOW TEN YEARS LATER I'D BE STILL HERE DOING WHAT I'M DOING I'M NOT SURE WHAT IT BELIEVES YOU I WAS VERY SCARED AND FRIGHTENED AT THAT POINT 
10220007 YOU KNOW I FINISHED MY CHEMOTHERAPY AND RADIATION THERAPIES IT LEFT ME SOMETHING I WOULD CALL BONUS TIME YOU KNOW THAT THOSE THERAPIES ARE HORRENDOUS BUT YET THEY GIVE YOU EXTRA 
10220008 OPPORTUNITY OF LIFE AND YOU KNOW I'VE BEEN ABLE TO HAVE A CHANCE TO SPEND TIME AND BLESS PEOPLE AND ENCOURAGE THEM AND PEOPLE GOING THROUGH THEIR OWN ADVERSITIES NOT JUST CANCER BUT 
10220009 YOU KNOW IF LOTS OF PEOPLE WHO'VE LOST THEIR JOBS LOST THEIR MARRIAGES LOST SO YOU KNOW THEIR BUSINESS OR THEIR HOME OR YOU KNOW FROM WORST LOST A CHILD AND YOU KNOW 
10220010 ALL OF IT BOILS DOWN TO ONE COMMON WORD AND THAT'S LOSS I LOST HALF MY TONGUE I LOST A LOT OF STUFF BUT THE THE WHOLE IDEA OF A FIRST IS THAT LOST PIECE AND 
10220011 YOU KNOW IS YOU KNOW YOU KNOW I LOST MY MY BUSINESS MY MY HOUSE MY CAR MY WIFE LEFT OUR MARRIAGE 
10220012 AND I GOT CANCER ALL IN A VERY SHORT PERIOD OF TIME AND IT SOUNDS HORRIBLE BUT YET AT THE SAME TIME IS IT'S EASY TO FOCUS ON WHAT WE DON'T HAVE AND NOT FOCUS ON WHAT WE DO 
10220013 HAVE AND THAT THAT AMONG THINGS THAT DID STEAL FROM ME WAS MY INVINCIBILITY YOU KNOW WE THINK WE'RE ALL IMMORTAL WE'RE NOT GONNA DIE WE DON'T THINK ABOUT DEATH WE DON'T WANT TO THINK ABOUT DEATH AND WE 
10220014 BUT BEING FACED WITH THAT I REALIZE WOW I MIGHT DIE SOMEDAY YOU KNOW I KNOW THAT SOUNDS SILLY BUT THAT WAS A HUGE THING FOR ME REALIZED I'M MORTAL 
10220015 AND THIS IS A POSSIBILITY THAT COULD HAPPEN SO BUT BEING ABLE TO CARE FOR FAMILY AND FRIENDS AND STILL BE HERE IT'S A HUGE BLESSING SO THOSE EXTRA 
10220016 YEARS I'VE HAD SO FAR AS THESE LAST FIVE HAVE BEEN I'VE BEEN AWESOME THERE'S A EXPRESSION THAT I'VE HEARD AND YOU'VE PROBABLY HEARD BEFORE THAT IT'S NOT SO MUCH LIFE IS A JOURNEY 
10220017 BUT IT'S NOT A DESTINATION YOU KNOW SO LIFE IS NOT ABOUT GETTING SOMEWHERE OR THE GOALS WE HAVE TO GET SOMEWHERE IT'S ABOUT THAT PROCESS ALONG THE WAY IN TWO THOUSAND FIFTEEN 
10220018 I HAD LOST MY TEACHING ASSISTANT SHERRY WAISHUN AS SHE'VE BEEN TEACHING WITH ME FOR GOSH NINE YEARS TOTAL I THINK AT THAT POINT AND AN AMAZING WOMAN AND A 
10220019 GOOD FRIEND AND SHE WAS TAKEN FROM ME SHE AND HER HUSBAND WERE INVOLVED IN A SPORTING INCIDENT WHERE SHE WAS KILLED TRAGICALLY AND YOU KNOW 
10220020 HUGE LOSS THAT YEAR BUT IN THE SAME TIME THAT YEAR I I MET THE WOMAN I'M MARRIED TO NOW I MET KAREN AND SHE WAS A HUGE BLESSING TO ME SO YOU KNOW LIFE THROWS YOU ALL KINDS OF THINGS AND 
10220021 AND OUR FOCUS IS A HUGE HUGE PIECE OF HOW WE'RE GONNA SUCCEED IN THAT IT'S EASY TO LET THE LOSS AND HARDSHIP WE HAVE 
10220022 IT'S EASY TO FOCUS ON THAT AND HAVE IT JUST KIND OF ENTRAP OUR ENTIRE ATTENTION AND FOCUS NOT WE DON'T HAVE OUR FOCUSING SO MUCH WHAT WE'VE LOST AND WE DON'T HAVE WE FORGET WHAT WE DO HAVE 
10220023 SO MAYBE A PARENT LOST A CHILD AND THEY'RE FORGETTING THE FACT IF YOU HAVE TWO OTHERS THAT THEY'RE NOT SPENDING TIME WITH BECAUSE THEY'RE SO SO FOCUSED ON WHAT THEY DON'T HAVE ANYMORE IN THAT 
10220024 SO I WOULD JUST ENCOURAGE YOU TO FOCUS ON WHAT YOU DO HAVE FOCUS ON THE BLESSINGS IN LIFE AND BLESSINGS ARE COMING YOUR WAY ALONG THAT PROCESS YOU KNOW NOW I HAVE A WIFE THAT LOVES ME DEARLY I'VE GOT 
10220025 THREE DAUGHTERS WHO I JUST LOVE INCREDIBLY I'M VERY PROUD OF THEM I HAVE PARENTS IN THE EIGHTIES WHO ARE THRIVING AND DOING WELL I'M BACK TO TEACHING SEMINARS 
10220026 THAT I LOVE NATIONALLY YOU KNOW I I EVEN HAD TO GO TO EUROPE LAST YEAR AND DRIVE THE AUTOBAHN AND DECREASING FROM HUNDRED HUNDRED AND TWENTY MILES 
10220027 PER HOUR FOR QUITE A WHILE THAT WAS JUST LIKE YOU KNOW A DREAM OF MINE AND I HAD NO IDEA THE AMAZING THINGS THAT WERE GOING TO COME AFTER HAVING CHEMOTHERAPY 
10220028 RADIATION AND THINKING I WAS GOING TO BE GONE SO THE BUSES ARE THERE THE REST IS VIDEOS FOR PEOPLE WHO'VE HAD HEMIGLOSSECTOMY OR 
10220029 ABOUT TO HAVE ONE OR MAYBE FRIENDS AND FAMILY WHO ARE DOING RESEARCH AND TRYING TO SUPPORT SOMEBODY WHO'S GONE THROUGH ONE OR IS ABOUT TO GO THROUGH ONE SO HE WAS SOME INFORMATION SPECIFICS 
10220030 THINGS THAT I'VE BEEN THROUGH THE LAST FIVE YEARS MAYBE HERE'S SOME THINGS YOU MIGHT NOT EXPECT THINGS I WASN'T TOLD THAT MIGHT HAPPEN SO I'LL GO THROUGH THOSE BUT 
10220031 BEFORE I TALK ABOUT THE NEGATIVES AGAIN REGARDLESS WHAT THE NEGATIVE SIDE EFFECTS AND ALL THE STUFF THAT'S BAD THE NUMBER ONE THING IS I'M ALIVE IT'S I'M ALIVE TO EVEN COMPLAIN AND 
10220032 PEOPLE THINK WOW I HAVE ALL THESE PROBLEMS BUT YEAH BUT YOU'RE ALIVE YOU KNOW SO THE DOWNSIDE OF TREATMENT YOU SHOULD LIVE AND THAT'S THE WHOLE POINT OF A TREATMENT IS TO EXTEND THAT LIFE OPPORTUNITY 
10220033 SO SIDE EFFECTS WISE THERE ARE NUMEROUS ONES THAT I'VE HAD ACTUALLY PROBABLY NEARLY ALMOST TWO DOZEN BUT THE BIGGER ONES THAT I HAVE ARE HAVING AN EFFECT 
10220034 BACK THE FIRST ONE WAS A SHOW UP WAS CALLED ORNATE SIGN WHICH IN MY GO FOR A WALK OR SOMETHING EVEN DURING TREATMENT I PUT MY CHIN TO MY CHEST AND IT BE THE SUDDEN SURGE A 
10220035 THE PAINFUL SURGE IN MY LOWER BODY BECAUSE I ALMOST NUMB AND TINGLY AND JUST BECOME A WEAK ALL AT ONCE AND THAT'S SOMETHING THAT CAME SPECIFICALLY BECAUSE I HAD A CHEMOTHERAPY CALLED 
10220036 CISPLATIN WITH CERVICAL RADIATION THAT COMBINATION SOME PEOPLE DOES CAUSE ORNATE SIGN AND SO BE AWARE OF THAT IT'S NOT GONNA 
10220037 KILL ME IT'S JUST NOT FUN ESPECIALLY IF I'M ACTIVE OR SOMETHING I PUT MY CHIN DOWN THAT MIGHT HAPPEN TO ME MY TISSUES WERE WEAKENED CHEMOTHERAPY 
10220038 WEAKENS YOUR TISSUES FOR YEARS AND YEARS TO COME AND I WAS INSTALLING A AIR CONDITIONER THIS LAST SUMMER I WAS HAVING TWENTY FIVE 
10220039 POUND AIR CONDITIONER I WASN'T ASKING FOR HELP LIKE I SHOULD HAVE AND A HEAVY DUTY MOUNT I BOUGHT FROM A LOCAL HOME STORE AND I WAS INSTALLING IT AND THE MOUNT BROKE AND TRY TO 
10220040 CATCH THE AIR CONDITIONER WITH ONE HAND AND IT TORE THREE MUSCLES RUNNING OFF MY SHOULDER AND HAD TO HAVE SURGERY FOR THAT MATTER OF FACT ON THE LAST VIDEOS YOU CAN PROBABLY SEE MY BRACE AND I DIDN'T SAY MUCH ABOUT IT AT THE TIME 
10220041 BUT SO YOUR TISSUES WERE WEAKENED PERMANENTLY AND IT HAD A BIG EFFECT ON ME I HAVE SOMETHING CALLED INTERMITTENT PARESTHESIAS AND THE LEFT SIDE OF MY FACE IF I TURN MY HEAD TO THE LEFT FOR 
10220042 VERY LONG AT ALL THE ENTIRE SIDE OF MY FACE AND NECK TINGLES IT'S KIND OF PAINFUL TINKLING IT BECOMES A NUMB AND IT HURTS SO I DON'T TURN LEFT VERY MUCH SO I STILL 
10220043 DO AND WE'LL TALK ABOUT THAT IN A SECOND BUT ONE OF THE BIGGEST THINGS LATELY THAT HAS HAPPENED PROBABLY THE LAST SIX MONTHS IS A CONDITION CALLED CERVICAL DYSTONIA 
10220044 OR SPASMODIC TORTICOLLIS AND SO YOU MIGHT SEE IT BUT ONCE IN A WHILE WHO ACTUALLY HAVE THE MUSCLES TIGHTEN BECAUSE IT HAS AN ANGLE MINE WANTS TO DO THAT BUT I FIGHT IT 
10220045 AND SO MY MUSCLES ARE CONSTANTLY IN BATTLE THE ANTAGONIST ARE FIGHTING BACK AND FORTH TO KEEP MY NEXT STREET BUT THEY SPASM CONSTANTLY YOU'LL SEE MY MUSCLES JUST POP UP REALLY HARD IN 
10220046 BACK I'VE TRIED THREE ROUNDS OF OF HAVING BOTOX DONE MY NECK AND IT'S A CRAZY EXPENSIVE PROCESS 
10220047 AND IT WEAKENS THE MUSCLE AND DOESN'T ALLOW IT TO FUNCTION AS WELL SO FOR ME THAT MAKES ME NERVOUS I DON'T WANT TO HAVE A WEAK MUSCLES IN MY NECK EXTRA IF I TRIP OR CURB OR SOMETHING I CAN'T SUPPORT MYSELF SO 
10220048 ANYWAY THAT'S WITH THE WEIRD PART IS IS I KNOW YOU CAN'T HAVE THIS BUT IF I HAVE PARKINSON'S IN MY NECK SOMETIMES BECAUSE I'LL GET THESE THESE KIND OF BOBBING 
10220049 MOTIONS WHERE IT'S A RHYTHMIC TREMOR I AS I CAN'T I CAN'T HELP US I PUT MY FINGER IN THERE I'LL BEAT THE MUSCLE UP AND DOES THAT THAT RHYTHMIC PIECE IS VERY ODD 
10220050 BUT AGAIN SIDE EFFECT OF ALL THE TREATMENTS I HAVE NERVES TO GO THROUGH SCAR TISSUE AND ALL THAT MOVEMENT IS AFFECTING THE NECK AS WELL ANYWAY THERE'S MORE PROBLEMS BUT YOU GET THE 
10220051 IDEA SO YOU'RE GONNA HAVE SIDE EFFECTS FROM THAT BUT AGAIN I'M ALIVE I USED TO MAKE THIS VIDEO USED TO TALK TO YOU AND ENCOURAGE PEOPLE SO IT'S IT'S GOOD THEN PEOPLE ASK ME TO SAY YOU KNOW HOW YOU DOING 
10220052 I SMIRK IT'S LIKE SHOULD I COMPLAIN WELL NO IT'S NOT WORTH IT BECAUSE I RATHER TALK ABOUT THE POSITIVE THINGS THAT ARE GOING ON IN MY LIFE 
10220053 FOR THOSE WHO'VE HAD RADIATION AS PART OF YOUR TREATMENT IF YOU'VE HAD HEMIGLOSSECTOMY YOU'VE HAD RADIATION I HAVE SOME EXTRA IDEAS FOR YOU THINGS I THINK ARE IMPORTANT I'VE LEARNED 
10220054 I'VE MET PEOPLE WHO'VE HAD THIS HAVE NOT HAD GOOD ORAL CARE AND IT'S LOST THEIR TEETH OVER THE TEETH OF ROTTING OR FALLING APART SO I WAS BLESSED I 
10220055 HAD SOMEONE EARLY ON A FRIEND I WAS A DENTAL HYGIENIST AND SHE WAS ABLE TO GET ME SOMETHING CALLED A FLUORIDE VARNISH AND I WAS ABLE TO PUT THAT ON MY TEETH ON A FAIRLY REGULAR BASIS IS SOMETHING THAT 
10220056 A DENTIST WOULD DO WITH YOU TWICE A YEAR AS YOU'RE CLEANING PERHAPS BUT WITH THAT FLUORIDE VARNISH DOES IS IT ALLOWS YOU TO ACTUALLY HAVE IT KIND OF SLOWS THE 
10220057 DEMINERALIZATION OF YOUR TEETH IT HELPS TO STRENGTHEN THOSE AND ALSO HELPS TO AVOID DECAY OF THE TEETH AS WELL SO YEAH YOU KNOW FLUORIDE IS A POISON BUT THE SAME TIME AS 
10220058 USED PROPERLY CAN ACTUALLY HELP YOU QUITE A BIT I HAVE MY TEETH CLEAN FOUR TIMES A YEAR AND IT'S TWICE AS OFTEN IS RECOMMENDED BUT WHEN YOU HAVE LACK OF SALIVA AND 
10220059 I HAVE NO SALIVA FUNCTION IN MY MOUTH AT ALL IT ACTUALLY BAD FOR YOUR TEETH AND BED FOR YOUR MOUTH HYGIENE SO I HAVEN'T SEEN FOUR TIMES A YEAR MAKING SURE THAT WAS TAKEN CARE OF PROPERLY 
10220060 AFTER EVERY TIME I EAT ANY FOOD AT ALL I USE A WATER PICK OR OTHER TYPE OF PRODUCTS LIKE THAT I'VE THREE OF THEM ACTUALLY ONE FOR TRAVEL 
10220061 AND ONE IN THE KITCHEN ONE LIKE MY BATHROOM I'VE GONE EVERYWHERE I USE A WATER PICK TO CLEAN THE MOUTH OUT I USE A FLOSSERS STICK I'M FLOSSING THREE OR FOUR TIMES A DAY TO KEEP THAT STUFF OUT 
10220062 OF MY TEETH SO IT CAN'T FORM OF CAVITIES I'M SOMETHING YOU DON'T HAVE A TON MUCH TONGUE FUNCTION YOU CAN'T CLEAN FOOD I'VE YOUR TEETH ANYWAYS SO IT'S WORTHWHILE TO HAVE US IN YOUR IN YOUR POCKET A 
10220063 ANOTHER THING TO THINK ABOUT IS TALKING TO MAYBE A NUTRITIONIST OR TALKING TO SOMEBODY AT A HEALTH FOOD STORE BUT YOU WANT TO GET QUALITY NUTRITION TO BE ABLE TO HAVE 
10220064 YOUR BODY THE ABILITY TO HAVE THE OSTEOBLAST AND SUCH TO BUILD AND AND SUPPORT YOUR BONE FUNCTION AND BONE GROWTH SO YOU ARE LOOK AT HAVING 
10220065 HIGH QUALITY CALCIUMS AND SOMEBODY ABSORB AS WELL IN YOUR SYSTEM YOU WANT TO HAVE SOMETHING TO MAGNESIUM YOU WANT TO HAVE VITAMINS A C AND D ALL THOSE 
10220066 HELP WITH BONES AS WELL AND C'S JUST GOOD FROM A STANDPOINT OF YOU KNOW COLD AND FLU SEASON AND SUCH BUT BUT A BIGGER ONE TOO IS GOING TO BE JUST WORKING A STARCH ISSUE 
10220067 I HAVE A LOT OF STARCH ISSUE IN MY NECK IT'S VERY HARD IF I PULLED UP BUT I CAN ACTUALLY GRIND ON THIS THING AND EVERY DAY I'M DOING WORK ON THIS I'M ACTUALLY MAKING A VIDEO 
10220068 SOON SHOWING YOU SOME SOME SELF CARE AND HOW TO BREAK UP A SCAR TISSUE AND GET MORE RANGE OF MOTION BUT ANYWAY I HOPE THIS VIDEO HAS BEEN HELPFUL 
10220069 I HOPE FOR THOSE WHO'VE HAD THE PAST HEMIGLOSSECTOMY OR PEOPLE WHO WERE FEARFUL FOR FRIENDS AND FAMILY WHO ARE GONNA HAVE ONE OR HAD ONE IT'S GONNA BE OKAY IT'S NOT 
10220070 IT'S NOT FUN IT'S DESTRUCTIVE BUT AT THE SAME TIME AS IT GAVE ME A SECOND CHANCE ON LIFE AND IF I HADN'T HAD THIS DONE I WOULD HAVE BEEN DEAD IN TWO THOUSAND THIRTEEN AND HERE WE ARE 
10220071 TWO THOUSAND EIGHTEEN FIVE YEARS AND A COUPLE DAYS LATER I'M STILL AROUND SO THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR WATCHING AND SEND ME YOUR EMAIL SAYS YOU HAVE BEEN IF YOU HAVE ANY QUESTIONS A

10260015 GOAL TO GET FREE OF MY PEG TUBE THE PEG TUBE IS VERY FRUSTRATING BECAUSE IT IT'S MIKE RIGHT NOW I I HATE IT'S THE ONLY WAY IT WE'VE BEEN ABLE TO EAT

10260020 YOU DIDN'T HAVE ANY KIND OF METASTASES INTO YOUR LYMPH NODES AT ALL SO YOU DIDN'T HAVE TO DEAL WITH THAT YOU JUST HAD YOUR TONGUE SURGERY ITSELF 
10260021 AND YOU HAVE OPTED TO TAKE WHAT PATH THEN AS FAR AS TREATMENT AFTER THE SURGERY YOU'RE DOING ANYTHING ELSE BESIDES THAT RIGHT SO I HAD A PARTIAL GLOSSECTOMY 
10260022 LAST YEAR AND I THOUGHT OF THE CREATION AND BRACHYTHERAPY AND THEN UNFORTUNATELY I HAVE REOCCURRENCE IN JULY OF 
10260023 2015 AND I HAD TO HAVE THE HEMIGLOSSECTOMY SO AFTER SURGERY YOU KNOW I COULD COULD HAVE ARBITRATION CHEMO 
10260024 BUT BECAUSE MY MARGINS WERE CLEAR AND IT WHAT DO NOT EXPECT MY LYMPH NODESS I DECIDE TO JUST HAVE MY DOCTOR 
10260025 CROSSING MIAMI EVERY MONTH SO I'M PROBABLY SEEING AT LEAST TWO DOCTORS A MONTH AND HAVING A PET SCAN EVERY THREE MONTHS TO HOPE THAT YOU KNOW EVERYTHING WILL BE 
10260026 CLEAR RIGHT SO FAIR MARGINS ARE GOOD MINE WERE CLEAR ALSO BUT THEY WERE VERY VERY THIN AND SO THAT IN COMBINATION WITH HAVING MY LYMPH NODE EXPLODING LIKE A 
10260027 SQUISHED BLUEBERRY MY DOCTOR SAID THAT MADE IT MORE NECESSARY SO TELL ME MORE I'M ON TALK ABOUT THE KIND OF UNDERSTAND HOW THIS AFFECTED YOU YOU GOT THE NEWS 
10260028 THAT YOU HAVE TO GOT THE HEMIGLOSSECTOMY THAT HALF YOUR TONGUE REMOVED HOW DID THAT AFFECT YOU SO MY I HAD GONE TO THE DOCTOR AND GETTING 
10260029 BIOPSY HE THOUGHT SOMETHING HARD ON MY TONGUE AND HE HAD RUSHED YOUR BIOPSY THE FOLLOWING DAY GET A PHONE CALL AS I'M DRIVING HOME 
10260030 AND MY DOCTOR TOLD ME YEAH I HAVE CANCER AGAIN AND I WAS DEVASTATED AND MY INITIAL REACTION WAS NO MORE SURGERY 
10260031 I CAN'T HANDLE A NEW SURGERY CUZ I ALREADY HAD TWO SURGERIES PRIOR AND AFTER THINGS GOING 
10260032 HOME THINK ABOUT CRYING SAYING WHY AGAIN WHY DID IT HAPPEN GETTING I JUST LIKE THAT AND DOING MY RESEARCH YOU KNOW I 
10260033 FOUND YOU ONLINE AND OKAY WELL HE DID IT I COULD DO IT AND HE SOUNDS GREAT YEAH SO YOU WERE MY INSPIRATION TO DO 
10260034 THE SURGERY GREAT OKAY WELL IT'S POSSIBLE I COULD GET THROUGH IT AND GIVE KNOW I HAVE QUALITY OF LIFE BECAUSE I WAS BEING TOLD 
10260035 WHO GOT MY QUALITY OF LIFE WOULD BE VERY DIFFERENT YEAH QUALITY OF LIFE IS AS I TALKED ABOUT THIS EARLIER IT'S KIND OF SUBJECTIVE AS FAR AS WHAT DO YOU WANT WHAT ARE YOUR EXPECTATIONS 
10260036 OF THE FUTURE AND OF COURSE BEING ALIVE IS NICE LOOKING AT WHAT THAT LOOKS LIKE I THINK THE HARDEST PART EMOTIONALLY IS I MEAN YOUR YOUR ELEMENTARY SCHOOL TEACHER 
10260037 RIGHT THESE ALSO SPEAK FOR A LIVING AND TO HAVE SOMEONE TELL YOU THAT YOU'RE TAKING AWAY YOUR ABILITIES AT LEAST SPEAK THE WAY YOU USED TO SPEAK IT'S SCARY MMM OKAY IT'S SO IMPORTANT 
10260038 POINT SPEAKING FOR MY PROFESSION I GO IN EVERY DAY I HAVE TO SPEAK CLEAR SO MY STUDENTS UNDERSTAND ME BY THE WAY MY PRINCIPAL I TOLD MY PRINCIPAL WHAT 
10260039 HAPPENED TO ME AND SHE WAS VERY UNDERSTANDING AND SHE SAID YOU KNOW TAKE THE TIME YOU NEED AND WHEN YOU COME BACK WE'LL FIGURE OUT SOMETHING FOR YOU SO 
10260040 I GOT ME SO OKAY WELL I KNOW I HAVE A PLACE TO GO AFTERWARDS IT MAY NOT BE THE SAME POSITION BUT 
10260041 WE'LL MAKE UP FOR IT SO I AM LOOKING FORWARD TO GOING BACK TO WORK I FEEL LIKE AT THIS POINT HOW I FOUND WHAT I WILL BE ABLE TO DO IT AND FEEL CONFIDENT 
10260042 RIGHT AND THE PRACTICE HAS HAD PEOPLE WHEN YOU KNOW AND PEOPLE CAN SPEAK WHAT'S NORMAL PEOPLE GOING TO KIND OF LISTEN TO YOU BUT WHEN THEY HAVE TO TAKE TIME TO LISTEN TO WHAT YOU'RE SAYING 
10260043 HOW YOU'RE ARTICULATING ENUNCIATING THEY ACTUALLY MIGHT LISTEN BETTER YOU KNOW IT'S A GREAT THING AND IT'S ACTUALLY LISTENED TO YOU MORE SO YOU HAVE TO ACTIVELY LISTEN SO 
10260044 WE HAVE TO CONCENTRATE AND GO HEAR EVERY WORD SO WHAT HAVE YOU FELT HAS BEEN THE MOST HELPFUL FROM YOU'VE HAD FRIENDS AND FAMILY EVERY GREAT HUSBAND WHO'S BEEN 
10260045 SUPPORTIVE FOR YOU AND WHAT KIND OF THINGS MADE IT EASIER FOR YOU TO GET THROUGH THIS AND THEIR SUPPORT WELL MY HUSBAND HAS BEEN AMAZING HE IS AFRAID

10260049 IT'S NICE YEAH IT'S UH YOU KNOW PEOPLE OFTENTIMES YOU DON'T KNOW WHAT TO SAY IF YOU'RE WATCHING THIS VIDEO AND YOU'RE HAVE A FAMILY MEMBER WHO'S ABOUT TO 
10260050 GO THROUGH THIS I'M JUST BEING THERE BEING AVAILABLE AND YOU KNOW PEOPLE THAT YOU COULD SAY OH I'M SO SORRY YOU'RE GOING THROUGH THIS WHEN YOU'RE GOING THROUGH IT HASN'T HELPED I'M THINKING WHY DOES SOMEONE JUST TO 
10260051 GIVE YOU A HUG TO STOP MY TO BE ABLE TO DO SOMETHING FOR YOU IT'S NICE BUT JUST TO KNOW THAT YOU'RE LOVED AND SUPPORTED AND YOU HAVE SOME OF THE COFFEE NEED SOMETHING YOU MIGHT BE ABLE TO SAY IT 
10260052 VERY EASILY I JUST A LOT OF TYPING ON MY LAPTOP AT FIRST I COULDN'T SPEAK I HAD TO YOU KNOW USE SOME LARGE FONTS AND TYPE OUT WHAT I NEEDED BUT BEING AND THAT'S HARD TO 
10260053 EVEN ASK ME FOR HELP IS THAT HARD TO YOU YEAH OH YEAH ABSOLUTELY I FEEL BAD HAVING PEOPLE COME OVER BUT THREE LOOKS LIKE OH MY GOD ONCE YOU JUST SHOW UP YOU KNOW 
10260054 YEAH GO GET ME I'LL CALL UP ON THE PHONE AND HE WAS DARING THE HOSPITAL FOR ME MAN IT WAS HIGH FIVE PEOPLE IN THE HOSPITAL WHEN I WAS THERE AND EVEN

10260056 WAS WRITING EVERYTHING DOWN T'S SO IMPORTANT TO HAVE SOMETHING THERE TO SPEAK ON YOUR BEHALF IF YOU'RE NOT FEELING WELL THEY COULD RUN IGNORING YOU'LL GET WHAT YOU NEED 
10260057 BUT IT'S MY CASE ANYMORE YEAH YEP GO TO BACKROOM YEAH I'VE WENT THROUGH THIS AS A SINGLE PERSON MY SISTER 
10260058 LISA HAD TWO SISTERS WHEN DEFINITELY SUDDENLY THERE WAS FARTHER AWAY BUT LISA CAME AND AND LIVED WITH ME FOR ABOUT SIX WEEKS YOU KNOW SHE WAS THERE THEN AFTER WHEN I ALMOST DIED FROM THE TREATMENT 
10260059 SHE WAS PANICKED AND SHE ACTUALLY WAS HAD A COT SHE SLEPT AT THE FOOT OF MY BED AND SHE GOT THROUGHOUT THE NIGHT LISTENING IF I'M STILL BREATHING YOU KNOW AND SHE WAS WORRIED MORE WORRISOME FOR MY 
10260060 FAMILY ALMOST I WAS TRYING TO PROP THEM UP MAKE SURE THEY'RE OKAY AND MY DAUGHTERS HAS THREE AMAZING DAUGHTERS AND THEY WERE VERY VERY AS A VERY HARD TIME FOR THEM BUT 
10260061 WE ACTUALLY GREW CLOSER AS A FAMILY BECAUSE OF THIS I THINK YOU'LL PROBABLY FIND THAT STEW IS STRENGTHENED IS THERE ANYTHING YOU'VE THIS 
10260062 THIS JUST I HATE TO SAY JOURNEY BUT THE SITUATION YOU'VE GONE THROUGH IS THERE ANYTHING YOU'VE LEARNED FROM THIS AS A HOW IT'S AFFECTED YOU IT DEFINITELY HELPED ME 
10260063 BECOME MORE SPIRITUAL BECAUSE I FELT LIKE I NEED SOMETHING MORE IF WE'RE DOING SOMETHING TO HOLD ON TO SO GIVE ME THAT HOPE 
10260064 SO WHEREAS NORMALLY I WOULDN'T GO TO CHURCH OR YOU KNOW I I WOULD PRAY BUT IT WAS A NICE DEEP PRAYING PRAYING NOW I FIND MYSELF THAT 
10260065 IT'S IMPORTANT FOR ME TO MEDITATE EVERY DAY AND SIT AND LISTEN TO MYSELF I'M LIKE MY BODY NEEDS WHERE I WAS ALWAYS PUSHING 
10260066 MYSELF AND ALWAYS ON THE GO BUT SINCE THINGS HAPPEN I THINK I'VE TAKEN MORE TIME FOR MYSELF AND WHAT MY BODY NEEDS 
10260067 IT'S A BUSY HUSTLE BUSTLE NOW YOU'RE GIVES TIMES REALLY CONTEMPLATE AND THINK ABOUT THOSE THINGS AND IF THERE IS SOMETHING SPECIFIC YOU WOULD SAY THAT 
10260068 YOUR FAMILY CAN SPECIFICALLY DO FOR YOU IN THE PROCESS OF SUPPORTING YOU WHAT WOULD BE THE MOST MAYBE THE THING OR MAYBE A COUPLE THINGS TO BE THE MOST HELPFUL THAT THEY CAN DO OR 
10260069 MAYBE THEY COULDN'T ENCOURAGE PEOPLE TO DO YEAH ABSOLUTELY STAY POSITIVE NO GOING TO KEEP UP BE I MEAN AT THE SAME TIME 
10260070 WAS DIFFICULT SOMETIMES WHEN EVERYONE WAS TOO PRIVATE BECAUSE I WOULD BE IN A DARK PLACE BUT NOW RIGHT OKAY IT WAS GOOD THAT EVERYONE TO KEEP STRONG FOR ME 
10260071 BECAUSE IT HELPED ME GET THROUGH THIS DIFFICULT TIME YEAH POSITIVES I MEAN OBVIOUSLY YOU KNOW THESE ARE PEOPLE ARE 
10260072 EMOTIONAL THEY'RE STRESSED THEY'RE YOU KNOW WHAT JUST SAYING YOU DON'T HAVE TO BE A YOU KNOW CHEERLEADER BUT AT THE SAME TIME AS THE PERSON IS ALWAYS WORRIED ABOUT YOU DYING IT'S LIKE YOU KNOW

10280001 I KEEP A BLOG CALLED NOT WHAT YOU HAD PLANNED DOT BLOG SPOT DOT COM AND THAT BLOG IS WILL YOU HELP PEOPLE REALIZE HOW BLESSED WE ARE I 
10280002 EVEN THOUGH THEY WERE NOT BEING BLESSED AT ALL THERE ARE THINGS AROUND US OF BLESSES CONSTANTLY BUT THIS VIDEO TODAY IS NOT FOR THOSE PEOPLE THIS VIDEO IS TO HELP PEOPLE WHO HAVE BEEN 
10280003 TOLD IS YOU'RE GOING TO HAVE SIGNIFICANT PIECE OF YOUR TONGUE REMOVED AND THAT DOESN'T COMING YOUR WAY QUICKLY AND I WANT TO ENCOURAGE YOU AND TO HELP 
10280004 YOU REALIZE THAT IT'S SOMETHING INTO THE WORLD BUT I TELL YOU I WAS HAPPY WITH MY STORY I'M NOW TWO MONTHS POST OP I WILL SPARE YOU THE DETAILS OF MY MULTIPLE 
10280005 SURGERIES BUT MY MAIN SURGERY TOOK PLACE WAS TWO MONTHS AGO TODAY IN THAT SURGERY TO REMOVE THE LEFT 
10280006 HALF OF MY TONGUE LITERALLY ACTUALLY SLIGHTLY MORE THAN THE LEFT HALF AND IT TOOK THE LEFT HALF OUT BECAUSE SO MUCH WAS REMOVED IS REPLACED WITH THE SKIN 
10280007 FROM MY FOREARM HE'S HAD A LARGE CHUNK OF SKIN THEY TOOK IT ALL THE WAY DOWN TO THE TENDON A NERVE AS WELL AS THE ARTERY AND VEIN 
10280008 ALL THE WAY DOWN TO MY ELBOW AND THAT PIECE WAS DESIGNED TO BE A FLAP TO REBUILD MY TONGUE TO GIVE IT SOME SUBSTANCE SO MY 
10280009 RIGHT HALF OF MY TONGUE THAT I WAS MOVING AROUND TISSUE MY LEFT HALF IS NOT A MUSCLE MY RIGHT HALF IS DOING DOUBLE DUTY IT LOOKS FAIRLY NORMAL 
10280010 IT'S THE AVERAGE PERSON YOU MAY NOT NOTICE BUT IT'S IT'S IT'S FIXED BUT IN THAT PROCESS THEY DIDN'T GIVE THANK TO MEANING 
10280011 WHO ARE FROM HERE TO HERE I QUARTER OF MY NECK THEY REMOVED IT TO THE LYMPH NODES ON THIS SIDE HE FOUND OUT THAT THE VERY TOP 
10280012 A NODE WAS BURSTING FORWARD WITH CANCER FROM BECAUSE OF THAT I HAD TO GO THROUGH CHEMORADIATION AND THANKFULLY I'M TWO THIRDS AWAY THROUGH THAT THAT PROCESS 
10280013 RIGHT NOW I'VE GOT ELEVEN MORE RADIATION SESSIONS TO GO AND ONE MORE CHEMO THEY'RE PRETTY LARGE DOSES OF CHEMO BUT 
10280014 ANYWAY SO HAVING THAT DONE I'LL ALSO LOOK AT THE TUBE COMING OUT OF MY BELLY I'LL SAVE YOU THAT BUT THEY ARE CALLED A PEG TUBE P. E. G. A PEG 
10280015 THAT ALLOWS ME BE FED WHEN I WOKE UP IN THE HOSPITAL I COULDN'T BREATHE I HAD A TRACHEOTOMY I HAD A BIG APPARATUS HERE 
10280016 AND NOW ALLOWED ME TO COUGH CHOKE BREATHE WHATEVER YOUR CASE WAS AND SO BETWEEN NOW I ONLY HAVE AIR AND THEN FOOD GOING THROUGH THIS TUBE IN MY STOMACH THAT'S HOW I ATE 
10280017 ATE FOR A COUPLE OF WEEKS AND EVENTUALLY AS ABLE TO START GETTING FOOD THROUGH MY THROUGH MY MOUTH OR MAYBE SOME UPDATES ON WHAT'S GOING ON WITH ME 
10280018 AND WHAT TO EXPECT CHEMO PORTION OF THIS IS PRETTY HARD I'M NOT GONNA SAY IT'S EASY IT'S DIFFERENT FOR EVERYBODY THE BIG PIECE OF 
10280019 I'LL GIVE YOU IS WHEN I TELL YOU TO TAKE YOUR ANTI NAUSEA MEDICATIONS STAY ON TOP OF THOSE BECAUSE KEEPING FOOD DOWN CAN BE DIFFICULT AND KEEPING YOUR FOOD DOWN YOU START LOSING WATER 
10280020 AND YOU START FEELING HYDRATED YOUR WHOLE SYSTEM STARTS TO SHUT DOWN SO STAY ON TOP OF THOSE YESTERDAY I SPENT ACTUALLY THE DAY AT THE HOSPITAL WITH I. V. 
10280021 HISTORY THOSE ARE GOING IN ME AGAIN BECAUSE MY SYSTEM STARTED HAVING DIFFICULTIES I AM LOSING MY VOICE RIGHT NOW BECAUSE OF RADIATION I WAS SPEAKING BETTER HERE JUST 
10280022 WEEK AGO BUT THE RADIATION IS BUILDING UP AND BUILDING UP AND IT'S LIKE GETTING A BAD SUNBURN OVER AND OVER OVER THE SAME SPOT IN THAT DESTRUCTION 
10280023 OF TISSUE IN THAT PROCESS HOPEFULLY IT WILL HEAL QUITE A BIT I'M A PUBLIC SPEAKER IF YOU LOOK AT MY VIDEOS YOU CAN SEE ITS LINKS PERHAPS ON MY BLOG 
10280024 AS WELL AS ROBERT B. HAASE H. A. A. S. E. S. E. YOU'LL SEE SOME OTHER VIDEOS I'VE DONE FOR SOME BUSINESSES THAT I OWN BUT I'M PUBLIC SPEAKER I HAVE A RADIO 
10280025 VOICE AT LEAST I HAD ONE SO I WILL ALSO GET THAT BACK BUT THE RADIATION IS DAMAGING TO A NUMBER OF STRUCTURES IS DAMAGING TO YOUR ANTERIOR NECK 
10280026 YOU SEE MY TRACHEOTOMY SCAR RIGHT HERE BUT THAT THAT ANTERIOR PART STARTED TO CINCH UP AND BECOME FIBROSED AND VERY LEATHER 
10280027 LIKE AND SO I TILT MY HEAD BACK YOU CAN SEE THIS I'M GOING TO ROCK MY NECK AND SO THEY GIVE ME SOME EXERCISES TO STRENGTHEN THAT 
10280028 THE THERAPIST AND ME WILL TELL YOU THAT'S FINE BUT WHAT YOU DO IS STRETCH THEM OUT THAT MEANS YOU GONNA PUT SOME FAVORS ON A SHORTENED MUSCLE THEN YOUR HEAD BACK 
10280029 EVERY DAY AND LENGTHEN THOSE TISSUE GET A LENGTH OUT OF THOSE YOU HAVE THE ABILITY TO MOVE THAT CONTRACTION THAT PULLING IS VERY VERY DIFFICULT IT MAKES IT HARD TO SWALLOW 
10280030 EVEN YOU KNOW NORMALLY WE USE SWALLOW YOUR GIVEN ESOPHAGUS AND TRACHEA SORRY TO SHARE THE SAME THROAT AND OF TRACHEA ON TRACHEOTOMIES 
10280031 BREATHING SO WHEN YOU WHEN YOU BREATHE IT GOES THROUGH THE ANTERIOR PIPE WHEN YOU SWALLOW IT COMES UP IT'S OUT OF THE WAY AND ALLOWS THIS EPIGLOTTIS PIECE 
10280032 MATERIAL TO FLOP OVER AND PROTECTS IT AND THE FOOD IS DOWN YOUR YOUR ESOPHAGUS SO NOW WHEN THEY PIERCE A HOLE THROUGH YOUR THROAT THESE 
10280033 MECHANISMS ARE USED TO WORK INDEPENDENTLY ARE NOW STUCK TOGETHER SO WHEN I SWALLOW NOW TO WATCH MY THROAT TAKES A MOMENT JUST A SECOND 
10280034 IT LIFTS A WHOLE THROAT SO IT BECOMES VERY DIFFICULT TO EVEN SWALLOW BECAUSE IT'S MOVING SO MUCH TISSUE AND IT'S AN EXERCISE EACH TIME I SWALLOW 
10280035 IT'S WORK AND SO MAKE SURE YOU KEEP THOSE STRETCHED OUT KEEP THOSE AREAS MOVING AS MUCH AS POSSIBLE DON'T OVERDO IT IF YOU MEASURE THE LYMPH NODES TAKING OUT YOUR OWN 
10280036 CAUSES LYMPHOEDEMA TALK TO YOUR DOCTOR ABOUT IT BUT MAKE SURE YOU ARE STRETCHING THOSE AREAS OUT THAT RADIATION ALSO BESIDES AFFECTING THAT AFFECTS YOUR 
10280037 SALIVARY GLANDS I CONSTANTLY HAVE TEA OR WATER NEARBY I JOKED ABOUT HAVING A BEER HELMET PUT ON 
10280038 I GONNA HAVE THESE TUBES COMING DOWN TO DRINK CONSTANTLY BUT YOUR SALIVA A IS SO IMPORTANT IT'S IMPORTANT FOR YOUR TEETH AS ARGUMENTS ABOUT YOU KNOW 
10280039 SHE'S FOR IT OR NOT BUT YOUR SALIVA IS WHAT KEEPS US HAVING STRONG TEETH AND WHEN THAT STOPS YOUR TEETH STARTS TO GET SOFTER SO YOU 
10280040 DENTIST SHOULD BE MAKING YOU FLUORIDE TRAYS AND YES IT'S POISON IT'S A SMALL AMOUNT BUT LACK OF TEETH AND LACK OF NUTRITION IN YOUR BODY IS EVEN WORSE SO BE 
10280041 CAREFUL AND DO SOME RESEARCH ON THAT BUT YOU PROBABLY WANT TO HAVE SOME GOOD QUALITY TRAYS MADE AND EVERY DAY YOU GUYS TAKE CARE OF YOUR TEETH BECAUSE THEY BECOME SOFTER 
10280042 AND BECOME MORE BRITTLE AND YOU CAN ACTUALLY LOSE YOUR TEETH SO PARTICULARLY DENTAL HYGIENE FROM THAT THROUGH SALIVA EXPANDS WHEN A SUSPECTED PRODUCTION ESPECIALLY I'VE TALKED 
10280043 PEOPLE WHO ACTUALLY HAD TOO MUCH SALIVA MADE AFTERWARDS TOWARDS MUCOSITIS IT WAS EVEN THICKER MORE LIKE GUM YOU KNOW IT'S HARD FOR THEM TO SWALLOW SO 
10280044 IT AFFECTS EVERYONE SLIGHTLY DIFFERENTLY BUT IT DOES DAMAGE YOUR SALIVA AS WELL MY VOICE RIGHT NOW IS HOARSE FROM ACTUALLY 
10280045 BE GROSS BUT THROWING UP YESTERDAY IT STRAINED MY THROAT QUITE A BIT BUT IT'S ALSO BEEN HOARSE ANYWAY MOSTLY FROM THE 
10280046 RADIATION AND THE RADIATION DOES AFFECT THE STRUCTURES IN THERE I HAVE SORES ALL AROUND MY MOUTH ACTUALLY MY TONGUE IS MY LEAST PAINFUL 
10280047 ISSUE RIGHT NOW I'VE GOT SO STITCHES IN THE VERY BACK HOLDING THESE STRUCTURES TOGETHER BUT THERE'S SORES IN THE TISSUES 
10280048 THE MOUTH AND THEY HURT WHEN YOU WAKE UP IN THE NIGHT AND YOUR MOUTH IS DRY AS PAPER SALIVATE A GLASS OF WATERS TO HELP REHYDRATE THEIR MOUTH AND REHYDRATE 
10280049 SORES SO PAIN MEDICATIONS I TAKE RIGHT NOW THIS PROCESS WE FOUND THE BEST WAY IS HAVE A PATCH SO I HAVE A 
10280050 A PATCH TRANSDERMAL PATCH IT GIVES ME SOMETHING SLOWLY A PAIN HERE IS VERY SMALL PAIN MEDICATION BUT IT NEVER GETS BAD 
10280051 AN ADDITIONAL PAIN MEDS YOU CAN TAKE IT ON TOP OF THAT BUT IT GETS PRETTY PAINFUL ESPECIALLY WHEN YOU JUST GOING TO SCORE YOUR MOUTH IMAGINE HAVING MANY SORES YOUR MOUTH SO THAT'S GOING TO BE COMING 
10280052 BE PREPARED FOR THAT AND DON'T BE AFRAID OF TAKING PAYMENT SO IT'S NECESSARY FOR CERTAIN SOUNDS I SAW HER NOT MAKE VERY WELL 
10280053 LIKE K'S EVER HOLD MY G'S I COULD COME AND GO EVEN A MERRY KISS THAT NOISE A PUCKERING SOMETIMES AS A LOSS OF VACUUM AND 
10280054 I CAN'T EVEN MAKE THAT NOISE SO YOUR YOUR SOUNDS THROUGH INFLAMMATION OR COME AND GO INFLAMMATION YOUR THROAT INFLAMMATION YOUR TONGUE ALL THOSE PIECES 
10280055 WERE COMING TO GO AND SO WHEN YOU THINK YOU'VE GOT A CERTAIN AMOUNT OF RECOVERY IT MAY OR MAY NOT BE THERE BECAUSE IT WILL COME AND GO 
10280056 I SHOULD BE DONE ABOUT TWO MORE WEEKS OF THERAPY AND I'M TOLD IT'S GONNA BE ABOUT A MONTH BEFORE ALL THE SORES 
10280057 ARE CHILL AND I START DIVING BACK TOWN THE BIGGEST THING FOR ME HAS BEEN FOOD I BESIDES THE WAY CHEMO MAKES THINGS TASTE LIKE 
10280058 PAPER OR MY FRIEND TASTES CARDBOARD WHEN SHE HAD HERS CHEMO TAKES AWAY FROM YOUR FLAVOR WELL IMAGINE EATING 
10280059 PASTE WITHOUT THE MINTY SMELL I MEAN LITERALLY YOU HAVE FOOD WITH NO FLAVOR IN THE BRAIN OFTEN WOULD GAG BASED ON THAT 
10280060 YOU HAVE FLAVORS TEXTURES AND THOSE KINDS OF THINGS SO IT'S GONNA BE HARD TO EAT THE RADIATION IS SEVERELY SEVERELY 
10280061 REDUCED ALL FLAVOR IN MY MOUTH AND I USED TO BE THE FIRST THING YOU LOSE IS SWEET SO THEY ARE GAIN WEIGHT BY USING ICE CREAM OR KEEP MY WEIGHT ON AND THE DOCTORS WANT YOU 
10280062 TO THEY WANT YOU TO KEEP YOUR WEIGHT ON BECAUSE YOU CAN'T FIGHT CANCER IF YOU'RE LOSING WEIGHT FAST MY BODY IS ACTUALLY DROPPING TO THE FORTY POUNDS THAT'S FOUR 
10280063 ZERO POUNDS SINCE THIS WHOLE ORDEAL STARTED AND IT'S HARD TO FIGHT WHEN YOUR SYSTEMS ARE LOSING THE VERY SUBSTANCE OF LIFE SO 
10280064 I'VE LOST NOW TASTE AND FIRST THING TO GO WITH SWEETS AND LASTLY LOSE THE SALT I WAS PUTTING SALT ON EVERYTHING I PUT SALT ON NOTHING OUT BECAUSE THE SALT 
10280065 BURNS THE SORES IN MY MOUTH SO NOW I USE THE PEG TUBE AND A PEG TUBE I'LL MAKE SURE OVERLAY THE VIDEO OVER THE PEG TUBE LOOKS LIKE 
10280066 DURING THIS VIDEO YOU'RE WATCHING BUT A PEG TOOL IS WHAT WE PUT SYRINGES INTO THAT ALLOWS ME TO SQUEEZE FOOD IN SLOWLY YOU CAN LITERALLY EAT AN ENTIRE MEAL 
10280067 A MATTER OF JUST MOMENTS I MEAN YOU DO THAT OVERWHELMS THE BRAIN DOESN'T WANT TO STAY IN SO MAKE SURE YOU TAKE YOUR TIME WHEN YOU GET THOSE KIND OF FEELINGS I WILL TELL YOU 
10280068 THAT THE HOSPITAL ARE GOING TO TRY TO SELL YOU ON THESE PRE MADE FORMULAS MADE BY VARIOUS COMPANIES I WON'T SLANDER ANY COMPANIES OUT THERE BUT THEY 
10280069 BASICALLY ADULT FORMULAS OF BALANCED NUTRITION I CARE MORE ABOUT MY BODY THAN MOST I WOULD SUPPOSE AND THOSE FORMULAS ARE NOT OKAY FOR ME 
10280070 SO YOU'RE USING A COMBINATION OF REAL FOOD I GET HIGH QUALITY SUPPLEMENT POWDERS HIGH QUALITY AND NEURO REPLACEMENT POWDER I DON'T HAVE 
10280071 ALL THE GARBAGE DON'T USE SUGAR I'M USING HIGH QUALITY STUFF YOU ALSO JUST OPEN UP A CAN OR YOU KNOW SOME KIND OF A 
10280072 SOUP AND PUT THROUGH A VITAMIX OR SOMETHING THAT SORTS OF LIQUIFIES YOUR FOOD WHATEVER YOUR FAMILY'S HAVING THAT DAY WILL TOSS SOME WATER AND TOSS THAT MEAL 
10280073 INTO A VITAMIX PUREE IT UNTIL IT'S TOTALLY LIQUEFIED AND YOU CAN USE THAT TO EAT BUT IF YOU EAT JUST FORMULAS OFTEN PEOPLE GET HEARTBURN 
10280074 IT'S NOT BALANCED NUTRITION OVER TIME YOU WANT TO MIX UP YOUR SYSTEM SO MAKE SURE YOU GOOD NUTRITION AND INVEST IN SOMETHING THAT ALLOWS YOU TO PUREE YOUR FOOD AND LIQUIFY IT 
10280075 I KNOW VITAMIX FOR EXAMPLE ACTUALLY WILL HEAT YOUR SOUP BY THE HIGH SPEED OF THE BLADES SO I'M NOT INVESTING IN VITAMIX I'M GETTING MONEY FROM THEM BUT 
10280076 INVEST IN SOMETHING SUPERIOR IN QUALITY I'VE TOLD THE NINJA IS PRETTY GOOD BUT MAKE SURE IT LIQUEFIES SO SMALL IN FITTING IS THE SMALL DIAMETER OF THE TUBE THAT THEY GIVE YOU 
10280077 YOU SO AGAIN I HOPE THIS HAS HELPFUL FOR YOU THIS IS JUST SOME INSIGHTS INTO WHAT'S GOING TO COME YOU KNOW IT'S NOW 
10280078 THE FIRST WEEK OF DECEMBER TWO THOUSAND THIRTEEN AND I'M TOLD THAT BY MAY OR JUNE I MIGHT GET MOST OF MY FLAVOR BACK ON THE ONE HALF OF MY TONGUE 
10280079 SO EVERYTHING'S CHANGED FLAVOR EVERYTHING THAT USED TO TASTE NORMAL IS DIFFERENT AND I'M LOOKING FORWARD TO HAVING THAT BACK BUT YOU CAN DO THIS 
10280080 DRINK LOTS OF WATER TAKE CARE OF YOUR BODY STRETCH BREATHE I KNOW THAT IT'S NOT THE END OF THE ROAD YOU GET THROUGH THIS SO HAVE ANY QUESTIONS 
10280081 GO TO MY BLOG AND AGAIN NOT WHAT YOU HAD PLANNED DOT BLOG SPOT DOT COM THERE'S AN EMAIL ADDRESS LINK ON THERE FEEL FREE TO EMAIL ME IF YOU NEED TO IF I HAVE A CHANCE 
10280082 TO ANSWER YOUR QUESTIONS AS I GO THROUGH THIS PROCESS I WISH YOU WELL I'M EXCITED FOR YOUR FUTURE YOU HAVE ONE 
10340001 I WAS DIAGNOSED WITH 
10340002 SQUAMOUS CELL CARCINOMA MY LEFT ANTERIOR TONGUE BACK IN MARCH TWO THOUSAND SIXTEEN ROUGHLY TWO YEARS AGO AT THE AGE OF TWENTY SIX I JUST KIND OF NOTICED 
10340003 A SMALL BUMP ON MY TONGUE ONE MORNING EARLY IN JANUARY AFTER THE NEW YEAR AND I WAS LIKE WELL THAT'S VERY STRANGE FOR LIKE A CANKER SORE OR SOMETHING A LITTLE BIT ON THE LARGE SIDE 
10340004 AND I KIND OF WAITED FOR IT TO GO AWAY AND IT DIDN'T THEN BY I GUESS LATE IN JANUARY NEAR THE END OF THE MONTH I'D WENT TO SEE MY DOCTOR WHO REFERRED ME TO AN ENT 
10340005 THE ENT SPOKE WITH ME AND SAID YOU KNOW THAT'S VERY STRANGE AND ASKED TO DO SOME TESTS TOOK A SWAB OF IT
10340006 IT SAID THIS MIGHT BE SOME SORT OF LIKE INFECTION SO HE GAVE ME I THINK THE MOCK CASILLA AND ANOTHER CREAM TO PUT ON IT THAT WOULD HELP
10340007 TAKE CARE OF ANY INFECTION THAT DIDN'T PROVE TO MAKE IT GO AWAY SO THEN HE SAID MAYBE IT'S AN ABRASION RIGHT AND GAVE ME SOME WAX PUT IN MY TEETH 
10340008 THAT AREA ABRASIONS THE TONGUE AFTER ANOTHER TWO WEEKS THAT DIDN'T GO AWAY AND HE'S LIKE WELL THERE'S NO WAY THIS COULD BE CANCER BECAUSE YOU'RE TWENTY SIX YOU'RE A
10340009 NONSMOKER YOU BARELY DRINK AND YOU EVEN HEARD GET HER CELL BUT LET'S DO BIOPSY NO WAY TO FIND OUT WHAT IT IS SO WE DID THAT AND A WEEK LATER I GOT THE PHONE CALL ON MY WAY
10340010 INTO WORK WHERE HE ASKED ME IF I COME IN THE OFFICE TODAY JUST BECAUSE I'M ABOUT THE ABOUT THE DIAGNOSE
10340011 OF THE DIAGNOSIS AND I SAID NO EYES WAITING FOR YOUR PHONE CALL AND THEY WILL HOW ARE YOU DOING WELL YOU TELL ME RIGHT AND HE BEGINS SAYING WELL 
10340012 IT APPEARS THAT YOU HAVE ONE OF A TYPES OF CANCER
10340013 AND THAT WAS HOW I FOUND OUT I REMEMBER IT'S GETTING INCREASINGLY WORRIED OVER TIME RIGHT YOU'D HOPE TO BE 
10340014 SOMETHING SMALL THAT THE DOCTOR COULD SEE AND THEN IMMEDIATELY GO THAT'S JUST YOU KNOW IT JUST IS AN ABRASION PUT SOME WAX IN IT WILL GO AWAY RIGHT AND AS TIME PASSED AND EACH
10340015 PROGRESSIVE TREATMENT DIDN'T TAKE CARE OF THE ISSUE AND IT BECAME MORE CLEAR THAT THIS MIGHT ACTUALLY BE A TUMOR JUST THE
10340016 WORRY AND THE FEAR KIND OF BUILT UP UNTIL YOU FIND IT ACTUALLY IS AND THEN THERE'S YOU KNOW THERE'S NO MORE FEAR ABOUT THE WHAT IFS FEAR ABOUT WHAT WHAT IS
10340017 PRIOR TO THE DIAGNOSIS I'D KEPT IT MOST OF MYSELF I MEAN FOR MY BOSS BEFORE THE BIOPSY THAT'D BE OUT FOR A DAY OR TWO JUST BECAUSE THESE THINGS AWAY YOU KNOW 
10340018 PART OF THE TONGUE IT MADE IT A LITTLE BIT PAINFUL TO SPEAK FOR THE NEXT DAY IT DIDN'T WANT TO ACTUALLY COME INTO THE OFFICE RIGHT AND THEN OTHER PEOPLE WOULD KNOW THEY'D NOTICE NOT REMEMBER AS MY
10340019 PHONE CALLED MY BROTHER I GUESS THE WEEK BEFORE THE BIOPSY JUST TALKING ABOUT WHATEVER GENERAL LIKE HOW ARE YOU DOING YOU KNOW OH I SAID A YOU KNOW PR 
10340020 THE DEADLIFT IN THE GYM THIS WEEK THEY'RE LIKE OH I WENT ON A DATE WHATEVER I FORGET WHAT WE'VE EVEN TALKED ABOUT AT THE END I WAS JUST LIKE BY THE WAY JUST RANDOM THIN 
10340021 I ACTUALLY SAW A BUMP ON MY TONGUE ABOUT A MONTH AND A HALF AGO IT HASN'T GONE AWAY SO I'M GONNA HAVE A BIOPSY LATER ON THIS WEEK JUST WISH ME LUCK YOU KNOW COULD BE CANCER 
10340022 I DON'T THINK IT IS JUST GIVEN HOW HEALTHY I AM BUT IT MIGHT BE AND HIS REACTION WAS THAT LIKE OH WELL THERE'S NO WAY IT COULD BE BECAUSE IF YOU HAVE CANCER THEN THE REST OF US WE'RE ALL WE'RE ALL SCREWED
10340023 RIGHT BECAUSE YOU KNOW APART FROM THIS ONE DIAGNOSIS I'M A VERY HEALTHY INDIVIDUAL RIGHT NOT DRINKING NOT SMOKING LIGHTLY DRINKING NOT SMOKING 
10340024 EVEN ON THE WHOLE I EAT ORGANIC AND EVERYTHING TRAIN RIGHT BUT HE'S JUST LIKE YEAH THERE'S NO WAY THEN YEAH
10340025 IT'S THE RIGHT TO BE SCARED IT MAKES SENSE IT'S NATURAL JUST GO WITH IT TRUST YOUR DOCTORS
10340026 IT'S THE BEST YOU CAN DO RIGHT I DID FIND IT KIND OF INTERESTING THAT AS I APPROACH SURGERY I ACTUALLY BECAME LESS
10340027 AND LESS SCARED AS I KIND OF BEGAN TO ACCEPT THAT THIS IS THE WAY THINGS ARE I AM SEEING VERY GOOD DOCTOR THERE'S
10340028 NOTHING I CAN DO TO CHANGE SITUATIONS SO I JUST NEED TO RELAX AND LET THE DOCTORS DO THEIR WORK BECAUSE IF YOU YOU KNOW YOU DON'T HAVE ENOUGH 
10340029 EMOTIONAL ENERGY TO EVEN WORRY ABOUT IT AND STRESS ABOUT IT JUST NOT SOMETHING YOU CAN EVEN MANAGE I WAS
10340030 FORTUNATE ENOUGH TO ONLY NEED A SINGLE SURGERY SO I HAD A PARTIAL GLOSSECTOMY REMOVING ABOUT A FIFTH OF THE FORM AS PART OF MY TONGUE 
10340031 AND THEN I HAD A SLIGHT NECK DISSECTION ON THE LEFT SIDE TO REMOVE THE LYMPH NODES WELL THIS WAS ACTUALLY MY FIRST TIME HAVING SURGERY IT WAS A 
10340032 BRAND NEW EXPERIENCE TO ME YEAH VERY SIGNIFICANT ONE FOR FOR A FIRST-TIMER RIGHT NEED HOPE YOU GET LIKE YOUR TONSILS OUT WHEN YOU'RE A KID AND KIND OF LIKE A WARM UP ROUND BUT 
10340033 NO IT WAS ALL DONE IN A SINGLE PROCEDURE LAST COUPLE HOURS I WAS IN AND OUT I THINK 23 AND A HALF HOURS YEAH I JUST REMEMBER 
10340034 I FELT VERY CALM BEFOREHAND GOING IN DIDN'T REALLY KNOW WHAT TO EXPECT MY PARENTS ARE WITH ME WHICH WAS A GREAT RELIEF GREAT HELP 
10340035 I'VE EVEN LIKE BROUGHT A BOOK WITH ME THINKING LIKE WELL MAYBE IF I FEEL ALL RIGHT AFTERWARDS AND I'M SITTING THERE LAYING MAYBE I'LL BE ABLE TO PUT SOME COHERENT THOUGHTS TOGETHER AND DO SOMETHING
10340036 A LITTLE BIT PRODUCTIVE YEAH LITTLE I KNOW THAT WAS NOT GONNA HAPPEN NO I REMEMBER BEFORE SURGERY THEY 
10340037 BEGAN WITH SOME OF THE ANESTHESIA I FORGET WHAT IT WAS SHORTLY BEFORE ROLLING ME OUT I REMEMBER PASSING THROUGH THE HALLWAYS
10340038 ON THE GURNEY AND THEN COMING INTO THE SURGERY ROOM NOT REALLY BEING THE SCENE MUCH APART FROM YOU KNOW WHAT'S DIRECTLY IN FRONT OF ME AND THEY BROUGHT ME WITH THE TABLE I REMEMBER THERE WAS LIKE A PINK
10340039 PILLOW ON ON THE TABLE SOME ROUND PILLOW AND THEY SAID ALL RIGHT NOW GET YOURSELF UP ON THE TABLE AND I WAS ALREADY VERY WOOZY BUT THIS POINT AND I WAS LIKE I KNOW A BIGGER GUY
10340040 YOU KNOW BUT LIKE THERE'S FOUR IF YOU HEAR LIKE CAN YOU HELP ME OUT LIKE JUST THINKING AND THEN IT'S LIKE I PUT YOUR HEAD IN THE PILLOW AND NOW WE'RE GONNA BEGIN BUT AS SOON AS THAT WE'RE GONNA BEGIN AND PUT THE
10340041 MASK OVER MY FACE I WAS JUST OUT EYES OUT AND THEN I WOKE UP A COUPLE HOURS LATER JUST EVERYTHING
10340042 RINGING A LOT OF PAIN DON'T THINK I'VE EVEN GOT OUT OF THE BED UNTIL THE NEXT MORNING 
10340043 I WAS WELL I WOKE UP IN THE WAITING ROOM AND THEY BROUGHT ME UP TO THE ROOM FOR THE NIGHT MAYBE I GUESS THEY'D SHIPPED ME FROM THE GURNEY TO AN ACTUAL BED I DON'T REMEMBER THAT PART EVEN AND IT WASN'T UNTIL
10340044 SOMETIME MAYBE SEVEN O'CLOCK IN THE MORNING WERE ACTUALLY GOT UP TO USE THE RESTROOM FOR THE FIRST TIME I REMEMBER THE STRUGGLE LIKE ACTUALLY GETTING UP AND GETTING OVER TO THE 
10340045 RESTROOM AND YOU KNOW BE LIKE I'LL HANDLE IT MYSELF LIKE LET ME GIVE THIS A SHOT AND HOW DIFFICULT THAT WAS YEAH WE DID NOT EXPECT THAT 
10340046 HE WAS VARIABLE AS THEY YOU KNOW CHANGED THE THE DRUGS I WAS RECEIVING IN THE IV SO INITIALLY I WAS IN QUITE A BIT OF PAIN
10340047 I LET THEM KNOW THAT YOU KNOW IT WAS YES EIGHT OR NINE ON YOUR YOU KNOW YOUR GENERAL OUT OF TEN SCALE RIGHT I THINK THE PAIN HAD ACTUALLY GOTTEN WORSE BY THE TIME I LEFT JUST BECAUSE OF THE REDUCTION
10340048 IN THE DRUG LOAD YEAH I HAD THE JP DRAIN RIGHT SO FOR THE NEXT SECTION PORTION THEY 
10340049 PUT A JP DRAIN WITH THE THE TUBE COMING UP TO HERE AND THEN I WORE THAT AROUND MY NECK THE NEXT FIVE OR SIX DAYS WAS MY BLING RIGHT
10340050 GETTING TO EMPTY IT I GUESS TWICE A DAY OR SO MEASURING THE FLUID THAT CAME OUT AND AFTER A FEW DAYS THE FLUID WAS A CLEAR ENOUGH AND THE VOLUME HAD REDUCED ENOUGH
10340051 THAT I WAS ABLE TO GET IT OUT SO I REMEMBER GETTING IN THE CAR WITH MY MOM DRIVING BACK UP TO HOPKINS BALTIMORE AND MEETING WITH THE 
10340052 NURSE ON HAND WHO'S GONNA BE ACTUALLY REMOVING IT IT'S WASN'T A MAJOR THING IT'S JUST YOU KNOW ONE TUGGING IS DONE IT WAS A YOU KNOW THAT WAS A MILD YOU KNOW
10340053 A BRIEF AND UNEXPECTED SENSATION AS I CAME OUT AND I WAS AMAZED TO EVEN FIT SUCH A LARGE VALVE IN SUCH A SMALL HOLE 
10340054 BY I GUESS MAYBE THE TWO WEEK MARK THE PAIN HAD GONE DOWN SIGNIFICANTLY SO THAT THAT WAS FINE WITHIN SEVERAL DAYS BUT JUST
10340055 THE ENERGY LEVELS AND THE ABILITY TO BE LIKE AWAKE YOU KNOW FOR MORE THAN TWELVE HOURS A DAY JUST THAT TOOK SEVERAL WEEKS TO RECOVER AND IT WAS QUITE A LOT OF DAMAGE
10340056 BOTH WITH GOT SICK TO ME REDUCING YOUR ABILITY TO EAT AND ACTUALLY GET THE NUTRIENTS YOU NEED TO RECOVER THEN ALSO JUST THE SIZE OF
10340057 THE INCISION THE NECK DISSECTION JUST TOOK A WHILE YOU WILL GET BETTER
10340058 THIS TAKES TIME BE PATIENT YOU KNOW I REMEMBER BEING KIND OF UPSET AFTER SURGERY AND THEY'RE LIKE YOU GO IN YOU'RE LIKE THIS WILL
10340059 CURE ME AND THEN WHEN YOU COME OUT I FELT SO MUCH WORSE THAN WHEN I WENT IN RIGHT BECAUSE YOU KNOW THE TUMOR IT DOESN'T ACTUALLY DO ANYTHING TO YOU JUST AS A
10340060 LITTLE LUMP ON YOUR TONGUE IT DOESN'T DOESN'T HAVE ANY IMPACT UNTIL IT'S METASTASIZED AND GONE AND IT'S BRINGING DOWN EVERY CRITICAL SYSTEM IN YOUR BODY RIGHT I JUST REMEMBER OF 
10340061 BEFOREHAND I FELT YOU KNOW ACTUALLY FINE AND THEN AFTER IT WAS JUST COULDN'T DO ANYTHING FOR FOUR WEEKS ON IT BUT THAT DID IMPROVE SLOWLY 
10340062 OH YEAH I DROPPED ABOUT WHAT TEN OR TWELVE POUNDS IN THE FIRST WEEK AT LEAST AFTER ABOUT A DAY OR SO I WAS ABLE TO DRANK SOME
10340063 SOME COOL BROTH ONCE AGAIN AT HIGH TEMPERATURE WOULD HAVE BEEN AWFUL RIGHT BUT AT LEAST THAT COLDER THAT WAS THAT WORKED BY 
10340064 MAYBE DAY FOUR I WAS IN A DIET OF APPLESAUCE AND BROTH AND THEN BY DAY SEVEN I WAS ON A DIET OF APPLESAUCE BROTH AND MILKSHAKES

10340066 LOTS OF BAKED BEANS SALMON VERY VERY TENDER COOKED CHICKEN YEAH NO DIFFICULTY WITH TASTE BUT MY 
10340067 TONGUE WAS VERY NUMB FOR THE FIRST FEW WEEKS AND EVEN TODAY IT DOES FEEL STRANGE LIKE EVERY TIME I SPEAK I CAN STILL TELL THAT THERE IS A A VERY
10340068 CLEAR IMBALANCE FROM THE LEFT AND THE RIGHT SIDE RIGHT I ROUTINELY BITE MY TONGUE YEAH I KIND OF HAVE A LITTLE BIT LESS KNOWLEDGE FOR WHERE IT IS IN MY MOUTH 
10340069 AND IT'S SURPRISING TOO THAT I BITE IT SO OFTEN BECAUSE THERE'S LESS OF IT THERE TO BITE BUT YEAH 
10340070 I DID GO BACK TO HOPKINS TO MEET WITH A SPEECH PATHOLOGIST FOR A COUPLE OF MEETINGS AND SHE'D GIVE ME SOME EXERCISES TO HELP WITH TONGUE MOBILITY FORTUNATELY BECAUSE OF THE
10340071 RATHER SMALL AREA THAT WAS RESECTED YOU KNOW I DON'T HAVE MANY LONG-TERM IMPACTS ON SPEECH RIGHT I CAN I CAN ENUNCIATE ABOUT IT AS GOOD AS I USED TO 
10340072 MY MOM STILL TELLS ME SHE CAN TELL THE DIFFERENCE RIGHT BUT THAT'S YOU KNOW YOUR MOM I'VE ALSO SEEN A PHYSICAL THERAPIST THERE'S A WHOLE
10340073 HOST OF EXERCISES AHEAD TO DO THEY'RE MOSTLY TO REGAIN THE NECK MOBILITY AND THE SHOULDER MOBILITY 
10340074 I'M NOT SURE YOU EVER FEEL PERFECTLY NORMAL AGAIN IT'S ONE OF THOSE THINGS SO IT'S LIKE THIS IS A RATHER LARGE AND UNEXPECTED CHANGE 
10340075 AND THEN IT IT CHANGES YOUR OUTLOOK FROM THERE ON RIGHT JUST THE THINGS YOU VALUE AND WHAT YOU CARE ABOUT
10340076 AND WHAT YOU PRETTY NO LONGER TOLERATE AND THE KINDS OF NONSENSE YOU WON'T WASTE YOUR TIME ON ONCE YOU'VE COME SO CLOSE TO
10340077 LOSING EVERYTHING YEAH SO KIND OF PSYCHOLOGICALLY EMOTIONALLY PERSONALLY I'M NOT SURE THAT YOU EVER GET BACK TO WHAT WAS NORMAL
10340078 BUT PRETTY SOON YOU KIND OF FEEL LIKE THIS IS WHO I AM NOW AND YOU BECOME OKAY WITH THAT PHYSICALLY
10340079 IT WAS A FEW MONTHS I STILL HAVE PLENTY OF REHAB TO DO AFTER SURGERY A ABSOLUTELY CRITICAL YEAH I WOULD NOT 
10340080 HAVE ANOTHER DO ANYTHING FOR MYSELF THE FIRST TWO WEEKS AFTER SURGERY I HAVE MY PARENTS WITH ME ONE OF THEM AT EVERY EVERY POINT IN TIME IMMEDIATELY POST-OP
