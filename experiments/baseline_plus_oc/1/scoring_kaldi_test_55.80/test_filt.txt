10030020 TEN MORE DAYS AND LISTENING TO THE DIFFERENCE IN MY SPEECH BUT I AM FEELING SO MUCH BETTER OKAY THANKS
10180001 THANK YOU SO MUCH LINDA I AM BOTH HONORED AND PRIVILEGED TO STAND BEFORE YOU TODAY MAKING MY DEBUT SPEECH AS AN ORAL CANCER SURVIVOR MY JOURNEY WITH ORAL CANCER STARTED IN FEBRUARY OF 2015
10180002 I MADE A NEW PATIENT EXAM AT A LOCAL DENTIST WE HAD MOVED TO TOWN RELOCATED AND PART OF MY NEW PATIENT EXAM WAS TO HAVE A PANORAMIC
10180003 AND ALSO TO HAVE AN ORAL CANCER SCREENING MY DENTISTS AT THAT TIME NOTICED THAT I HAD A DARK SPOT ON THE PANORAMIC THAT WAS BELOW THE GUM LINES THAT SHE REALLY COULDN'T
10180004 IDENTIFY SHE TOOK ME BACK AND DID AN ADDITIONAL 25 X-RAYS FREE OF CHARGE TOLD ME TAKE THESE TO THE ORAL SURGEON HELP LOCATE THE MASS AND SEE WHAT YOU'RE DEALING WITH
10180005 AND I TOOK THOSE TO THE ORAL SURGEON AND WE LOOKED AND GOT A BETTER IMAGING AND AT THAT POINT YOU MUST REALIZE I WAS THIRTY-FIVE YEAR OLD FEMALE MOTHER OF TWO
10180006 I HAVE AN EIGHT-YEAR-OLD DAUGHTER AND A ONE-YEAR-OLD SON HEALTHY I HAD NO SIGN NO SYMPTOMS NO PAIN THERE WAS NO SYMPTOMS OR ANY CLUES
10180007 THAT WOULD LEAD YOU TO THINK THAT THIS WOULD BE THE CASE WE TOOK BETTER IMAGING AT THE ORAL SURGEON AND THEY REALIZED MY MASS WAS THE SIZE OF A GOLF BALL GROWING INSIDE MY RIGHT MANDIBLE
10180008 SLOWLY SEPARATING MY JAWS IT WAS EVENTUALLY GOING TO BREAK IT SO AT THAT POINT WE TOOK A A WISDOM TOOTH DID A BIOPSY AND SENT IT OFF TO BE HAVE A BIOPSY
10180009 AND TWO WEEKS LATER THE RESULTS CAME IN WE ALL WENT MY HUSBAND AND I SCARED TO DEATH GOT THE BEST NEWS EVER HE SAID YOU'RE CANCER-FREE
10180010 IT'S WONDERFUL WE JUST NEED TO SEND YOU DOWN TO MU SC AND YOU NEED TO HAVE IT REMOVED BECAUSE OF THE SIZE AND LOCATION IT'S JUST TOO LARGE FOR ME TO DO IN THE OFFICE SO TWO WEEKS LATER
10180011 AGAIN WE WENT IN FOR THE AND THE HEAD OF THE DENTAL PRACTICE WALKED IN AND SAID I KNOW YOU'RE WORRIED ABOUT YOUR PATHOLOGY I SAID NO THIS GUY THAT GUY RIGHT THERE SAID EVERYTHING WAS FINE
10180012 AND HE SAID ACTUALLY IT REACTED POORLY WITH THE K-19 DYE AND WE'VE NEVER SEEN THIS BEFORE WE NEED TO READ BIOPSY BUT LET'S GO AHEAD TAKE IT OUT AS A MASS IN WHOLE
10180013 BIOPSY THE WHOLE SURFACE AND THEN DEAL FROM THERE SO WE WENT IN AND HAD IT REMOVED AND THEY TOLD MY HUSBAND IT WAS CLEAR THERE WAS NO NODULES THAT LOOKED VERY FINE
10180014 AND THERE SHOULDN'T BE ANYTHING TO WORRY ABOUT ANOTHER TWO WEEKS PASSED WE GOT THE PATHOLOGY REPORT HAD OUR APPOINTMENT DROVE TO CHARLESTON WHICH IS ABOUT A FOUR-HOUR DRIVE FROM CHARLOTTE THAT'S WHERE ALL MY DOCTORS ARE
10180015 AND WE WERE SITTING THERE AND I TOOK MY CHILDREN MY ONE-YEAR-OLD SON MY EIGHT-YEAR-OLD DAUGHTER AND NINE DOCTORS WALKED IN THE ROOM AND I JUST KNEW AT THAT MOMENT
10180016 THIS POINT WAS NOT GOING THE WAY WE THOUGHT IT WAS GONNA GO SO I REMEMBER SITTING THERE STARING AT MY CHILDREN AS THE WORDS CAME OUT OF THE DOCTORS MOUTHS THEY SAID WE'VE NEVER SEEN
10180017 THIS TYPE OF CANCER BEFORE WE DON'T KNOW HOW TO TREAT IT CHEMO AND RADIATION AREN'T EFFECTIVE ON IT THERE'S LESS THAN 80 CASES IN THE WHOLE ENTIRE WORLD SINCE IT WAS DERIVED
10180018 IN THE 80S I THOUGHT I SAID WHAT AM I SUPPOSED TO DO I WALKED OUT BY ANIMAL AND YOU'LL WANT TO GO FIRST THING I DID I TRIED TO WEBMD MYSELF INTO A DIFFERENT DIAGNOSIS
10180019 BUT THERE WAS NO INFORMATION NO RESEARCH NO STUDIES EVERYTHING WAS IN THE EARLY 80S AND IT WAS IN THIRD WORLD COUNTRIES IT METASTASIZED INTO
10180020 LUNG CANCER AND THE THE TRUTH AND THE HARSH REALITY BEHIND IT IS IS THERE'S NOT ANY SURVIVORS BECAUSE IT KILLS US WITHIN FIVE YEARS SO THE OFFICIAL DIAGNOSIS WAS CLEAR CELL
10180021 ANDROGENICAL CARCINOMA AND I WAS TOLD AT THAT TIME I WAS THE ONLY PERSON IN THE WORLD WITH THIS CANCER I LEFT THERE WITH NOWHERE TO TURN
10180022 NOBODY TO TALK TO THERE WASN'T A SUPPORT GROUP THERE WASN'T A FOUNDATION THERE WASN'T ANYTHING THAT COULD HELP ME SO FOR A MONTH MY HUSBAND AND I RESEARCHED THE BEST TO
10180023 OUR ABILITIES ON OUR OWN WE BOUGHT ALL THE CASE STUDIES FROM BACK IN THE DAY READ THEM NO KNOWN SURVIVORS AND REALLY DEALT WITH WHAT WAS FACING US AND ALAN
10180024 WHIM I DECIDED TO MAKE A GOFUNDME PAGE REALLY DIDN'T RAISE ANY MONEY BUT WITHIN 24 HOURS OF IT GOING VIRAL AND SOCIAL MEDIA I HAD AN EMAIL IN MY INBOX
10180025 FROM LINDA MILES AND SHE SAID I CAN HELP YOU CALL ME I KNOW WHAT TO DO AND NOT KNOWING LINDA OR OF ORAL CANCER CAUSE OR REALLY ANY FOUNDATION
10180026 THAT COULD HELP IN ANY WAY I REACHED OUT AND I CONTACTED HER AND SHE CONNECTED ME WITH A WOMAN WHO HAD BEEN IN SAN ANTONIO WHO HAD HAD A JAW REPLACEMENT AND KNEW THE TYPE OF SURGERY THAT I WAS FACING
10180027 THINGS LIKE THAT THEN SHE ALSO MENTIONED YOU KNOW I'VE HEARD OF THIS CANCER BEFORE I SAID EXCUSE ME SHE SAID WE HELPED ANOTHER FAMILY LAST YEAR SAME DIAGNOSIS
10180028 I SAID ARE YOU SERIOUS AND WITHIN THE SAME DAY I WAS ON THE PHONE WITH THE ONLY OTHER KNOWN SURVIVOR WITH THIS TYPE OF CANCER I SMILED I CALL MY CANCER BROTHER
10180029 AND WE ARE IMMEDIATE FAMILY THERE'S NO KNOWN ROUTE TO WHY WE HAVE THIS DISEASE THERE'S NOT IT WAS AN ENVIRONMENTAL IT'S NOT HEREDITARY THERE'S NO WAY TO STOP IT
10180030 IT'S 95 PERCENT AGGRESSIVE HE'S BEEN DIAGNOSED FOR THREE YEARS ON HIS SECOND REOCCURRENCE ALREADY AT THIS POINT JUST FINISHED HIS LAST SURGERY YES TWO WEEKS AGO
10180031 AND HE'S IN RECOVERY SO THE HARSH REALITY IS IS WE HAVE TO CHECK FOR ORAL CANCER WE HAVE TO BE DOING SCREENINGS MY CANCER WAS RARE UNDER THE TISSUE MAY NOT HAVE BEEN NOTICED
10180032 BUT I HAD A DENTIST WHO PAID ATTENTION TO THAT IMAGING AND SAW A TINY LITTLE DARK SPOT THAT CHANGED MY LIFE MY CANCER WOULD HAVE KILLED ME WITHIN SIX MONTHS IF I HAD NOT
10180033 FOUND IT AND SO I'M ONLY ABLE TO STAND HER TODAY BEFORE YOU BECAUSE OF A DENTIST WHO DID THEIR JOB AND WENT ABOVE THE STANDARD CARE PRACTICE AND BECAUSE OF
10180034 THE ORAL CANCER PAUSE AND THE WORK THAT THEY DO THEY SENT US A CHECK WHICH ALLOWED ME TO PUT MY SON IN DAYCARE I DIDN'T KNOW THAT THIS THAT YOU SEE NOW
10180035 MY TISSUE WAS ACTUALLY BONE AND TISSUE TAKEN FROM MY SCAPULA TO REPLACE IN HERE ALONG WITH A TITANIUM PLATE BUT TO LOOK AT MY ONE-YEAR-OLD SON AND KNOW THAT I WAS GOING TO GO THROUGH A RECOVERY
10180036 AND NOT BE ABLE TO PICK HIM UP AND CARRY HIM I DIDN'T KNOW WHAT TO DO THEY GAVE ME THE OPPORTUNITY TO PUT HIM IN DAY CARE AND CARE FOR HIM WHILE I WENT THROUGH RECOVERY AND THAT IS SOMETHING THAT I COULD NEVER PAY
10180037 THESE LADIES BACK FOR SO IF YOU HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY TO SUPPORT A FOUNDATION THEY DO WONDERFUL WORK
10300001 AND LUCKILY I WAS DIAGNOSED AND I WAS STARTED TREATMENT ALMOST IMMEDIATELY THE CHEMOTHERAPY WAS PRETTY GOOD
10300002 THEY'VE COME A LONG WAY NOW SO PEOPLE WORRIED ABOUT IT THEY SHOULDN'T I MEAN THEY HAVE DRUGS NOW YOU DON'T EVEN GET NAUSEAOUS THE TUMOURS ARE COMPLETELY GONE THE DOCTORS CAN'T FIND THEM SO I'M HAPPY
10330001 FROM CHICAGO ILLINIOS RETIRED FIRE FIGHTER AFTER THIRTY YEARS I KNOW THAT SOMETHING
10330002 BOTHERING ME UNDERNEATH THE TONGUE I WAS GETTING PRETTY GROUCHY WITH EVERYONE EVERYTIME THAT LITTLE GROWTH WOULD HIT MY TEETH I COULDN'T TAKE ALLERGIES I WAS ALWAYS IN A BAD MOOD
10330003 THE PAIN THAT I HAD WAS UNBEARABLE SO WHEN YOU SAY CANCER HURTS IT HURTS THEY TOLD ME I HAD
10330004 A SQUAMOUS CELL CARCINOMA I BELIEVE IT'S CALLED IF I HAD TO TAKE CARE OF IT THERE IS A FIFTY SOMETHING PERCENT THAT  
10330005 I WOULD DIE BUT IF I TAKE CARE OF IT THEN IT GOES UP INTO YOUR HIGH NINETIES THAT'S A NOBRAINER
10330006 I HAD THE CHOICE TO GO TO A DIFFERENT HOSPITAL BUT SOMETHING JUST DIDN'T FEEL RIGHT BUT THEN DR MARCO WHEN HE STARTED TALKING TO ME AND HE
10330007 HE MADE ME SO COMFORTABLE SO YEAH HE HE GOT ME REALLY CALM AND I WAS READY FOR ALL THIS I STILL DON'T BELIEVE HOW THEY JUST
10330008 THEY JUST CARED IT WITH EVERY EVERY SEEM LIKED ALMOST EVERY HOUR AND THE HOUR JUST CHECKING UP ON ME WHICH I THOUGHT THAT WAS NICE
10330009 I MEAN I DON'T SEE THAT YOU DON'T SEE THAT AT LEAST I DON'T SEE THAT EVERYWHERE BUT I SAW IT HERE NOW I STOP AND LISTEN TO PEOPLE THAT HAVE  
10330010 ACTUALLY GONE THROUGH STUFF I FEEL MORE AT HEART WHEN PEOPLE TELL ME YEAH I WENT THROUGH THAT OR MY MOTHER WENT THROUGH THAT IT'S LIKE WOW YOU GUYS REALLY WENT THROUGH A LOT
10330011 OF PAIN OR A LOT OF SOMETHING TOTALLY DIFFERENT THAT JUST GONNA CHANGE YOUR LIFE
10340001 I WAS DIAGNOSED WITH 
10340002 SQUAMOUS CELL CARCINOMA MY LEFT ANTERIOR TONGUE BACK IN MARCH TWO THOUSAND SIXTEEN ROUGHLY TWO YEARS AGO AT THE AGE OF TWENTY SIX I JUST KIND OF NOTICED 
10340003 A SMALL BUMP ON MY TONGUE ONE MORNING EARLY IN JANUARY AFTER THE NEW YEAR AND I WAS LIKE WELL THAT'S VERY STRANGE FOR LIKE A CANKER SORE OR SOMETHING A LITTLE BIT ON THE LARGE SIDE 
10340004 AND I KIND OF WAITED FOR IT TO GO AWAY AND IT DIDN'T THEN BY I GUESS LATE IN JANUARY NEAR THE END OF THE MONTH I'D WENT TO SEE MY DOCTOR WHO REFERRED ME TO AN ENT 
10340005 THE ENT SPOKE WITH ME AND SAID YOU KNOW THAT'S VERY STRANGE AND ASKED TO DO SOME TESTS TOOK A SWAB OF IT
10340006 IT SAID THIS MIGHT BE SOME SORT OF LIKE INFECTION SO HE GAVE ME I THINK THE MOCK CASILLA AND ANOTHER CREAM TO PUT ON IT THAT WOULD HELP
10340007 TAKE CARE OF ANY INFECTION THAT DIDN'T PROVE TO MAKE IT GO AWAY SO THEN HE SAID MAYBE IT'S AN ABRASION RIGHT AND GAVE ME SOME WAX PUT IN MY TEETH 
10340008 THAT AREA ABRASIONS THE TONGUE AFTER ANOTHER TWO WEEKS THAT DIDN'T GO AWAY AND HE'S LIKE WELL THERE'S NO WAY THIS COULD BE CANCER BECAUSE YOU'RE TWENTY SIX YOU'RE A
10340009 NONSMOKER YOU BARELY DRINK AND YOU EVEN HEARD GET HER CELL BUT LET'S DO BIOPSY NO WAY TO FIND OUT WHAT IT IS SO WE DID THAT AND A WEEK LATER I GOT THE PHONE CALL ON MY WAY
10340010 INTO WORK WHERE HE ASKED ME IF I COME IN THE OFFICE TODAY JUST BECAUSE I'M ABOUT THE ABOUT THE DIAGNOSE
10340011 OF THE DIAGNOSIS AND I SAID NO EYES WAITING FOR YOUR PHONE CALL AND THEY WILL HOW ARE YOU DOING WELL YOU TELL ME RIGHT AND HE BEGINS SAYING WELL 
10340012 IT APPEARS THAT YOU HAVE ONE OF A TYPES OF CANCER
10340013 AND THAT WAS HOW I FOUND OUT I REMEMBER IT'S GETTING INCREASINGLY WORRIED OVER TIME RIGHT YOU'D HOPE TO BE 
10340014 SOMETHING SMALL THAT THE DOCTOR COULD SEE AND THEN IMMEDIATELY GO THAT'S JUST YOU KNOW IT JUST IS AN ABRASION PUT SOME WAX IN IT WILL GO AWAY RIGHT AND AS TIME PASSED AND EACH
10340015 PROGRESSIVE TREATMENT DIDN'T TAKE CARE OF THE ISSUE AND IT BECAME MORE CLEAR THAT THIS MIGHT ACTUALLY BE A TUMOR JUST THE
10340016 WORRY AND THE FEAR KIND OF BUILT UP UNTIL YOU FIND IT ACTUALLY IS AND THEN THERE'S YOU KNOW THERE'S NO MORE FEAR ABOUT THE WHAT IFS FEAR ABOUT WHAT WHAT IS
10340017 PRIOR TO THE DIAGNOSIS I'D KEPT IT MOST OF MYSELF I MEAN FOR MY BOSS BEFORE THE BIOPSY THAT'D BE OUT FOR A DAY OR TWO JUST BECAUSE THESE THINGS AWAY YOU KNOW 
10340018 PART OF THE TONGUE IT MADE IT A LITTLE BIT PAINFUL TO SPEAK FOR THE NEXT DAY IT DIDN'T WANT TO ACTUALLY COME INTO THE OFFICE RIGHT AND THEN OTHER PEOPLE WOULD KNOW THEY'D NOTICE NOT REMEMBER AS MY
10340019 PHONE CALLED MY BROTHER I GUESS THE WEEK BEFORE THE BIOPSY JUST TALKING ABOUT WHATEVER GENERAL LIKE HOW ARE YOU DOING YOU KNOW OH I SAID A YOU KNOW PR 
10340020 THE DEADLIFT IN THE GYM THIS WEEK THEY'RE LIKE OH I WENT ON A DATE WHATEVER I FORGET WHAT WE'VE EVEN TALKED ABOUT AT THE END I WAS JUST LIKE BY THE WAY JUST RANDOM THIN 
10340021 I ACTUALLY SAW A BUMP ON MY TONGUE ABOUT A MONTH AND A HALF AGO IT HASN'T GONE AWAY SO I'M GONNA HAVE A BIOPSY LATER ON THIS WEEK JUST WISH ME LUCK YOU KNOW COULD BE CANCER 
10340022 I DON'T THINK IT IS JUST GIVEN HOW HEALTHY I AM BUT IT MIGHT BE AND HIS REACTION WAS THAT LIKE OH WELL THERE'S NO WAY IT COULD BE BECAUSE IF YOU HAVE CANCER THEN THE REST OF US WE'RE ALL WE'RE ALL SCREWED
10340023 RIGHT BECAUSE YOU KNOW APART FROM THIS ONE DIAGNOSIS I'M A VERY HEALTHY INDIVIDUAL RIGHT NOT DRINKING NOT SMOKING LIGHTLY DRINKING NOT SMOKING 
10340024 EVEN ON THE WHOLE I EAT ORGANIC AND EVERYTHING TRAIN RIGHT BUT HE'S JUST LIKE YEAH THERE'S NO WAY THEN YEAH
10340025 IT'S THE RIGHT TO BE SCARED IT MAKES SENSE IT'S NATURAL JUST GO WITH IT TRUST YOUR DOCTORS
10340026 IT'S THE BEST YOU CAN DO RIGHT I DID FIND IT KIND OF INTERESTING THAT AS I APPROACH SURGERY I ACTUALLY BECAME LESS
10340027 AND LESS SCARED AS I KIND OF BEGAN TO ACCEPT THAT THIS IS THE WAY THINGS ARE I AM SEEING VERY GOOD DOCTOR THERE'S
10340028 NOTHING I CAN DO TO CHANGE SITUATIONS SO I JUST NEED TO RELAX AND LET THE DOCTORS DO THEIR WORK BECAUSE IF YOU YOU KNOW YOU DON'T HAVE ENOUGH 
10340029 EMOTIONAL ENERGY TO EVEN WORRY ABOUT IT AND STRESS ABOUT IT JUST NOT SOMETHING YOU CAN EVEN MANAGE I WAS
10340030 FORTUNATE ENOUGH TO ONLY NEED A SINGLE SURGERY SO I HAD A PARTIAL GLOSSECTOMY REMOVING ABOUT A FIFTH OF THE FORM AS PART OF MY TONGUE 
10340031 AND THEN I HAD A SLIGHT NECK DISSECTION ON THE LEFT SIDE TO REMOVE THE LYMPH NODES WELL THIS WAS ACTUALLY MY FIRST TIME HAVING SURGERY IT WAS A 
10340032 BRAND NEW EXPERIENCE TO ME YEAH VERY SIGNIFICANT ONE FOR FOR A FIRST-TIMER RIGHT NEED HOPE YOU GET LIKE YOUR TONSILS OUT WHEN YOU'RE A KID AND KIND OF LIKE A WARM UP ROUND BUT 
10340033 NO IT WAS ALL DONE IN A SINGLE PROCEDURE LAST COUPLE HOURS I WAS IN AND OUT I THINK 23 AND A HALF HOURS YEAH I JUST REMEMBER 
10340034 I FELT VERY CALM BEFOREHAND GOING IN DIDN'T REALLY KNOW WHAT TO EXPECT MY PARENTS ARE WITH ME WHICH WAS A GREAT RELIEF GREAT HELP 
10340035 I'VE EVEN LIKE BROUGHT A BOOK WITH ME THINKING LIKE WELL MAYBE IF I FEEL ALL RIGHT AFTERWARDS AND I'M SITTING THERE LAYING MAYBE I'LL BE ABLE TO PUT SOME COHERENT THOUGHTS TOGETHER AND DO SOMETHING
10340036 A LITTLE BIT PRODUCTIVE YEAH LITTLE I KNOW THAT WAS NOT GONNA HAPPEN NO I REMEMBER BEFORE SURGERY THEY 
10340037 BEGAN WITH SOME OF THE ANESTHESIA I FORGET WHAT IT WAS SHORTLY BEFORE ROLLING ME OUT I REMEMBER PASSING THROUGH THE HALLWAYS
10340038 ON THE GURNEY AND THEN COMING INTO THE SURGERY ROOM NOT REALLY BEING THE SCENE MUCH APART FROM YOU KNOW WHAT'S DIRECTLY IN FRONT OF ME AND THEY BROUGHT ME WITH THE TABLE I REMEMBER THERE WAS LIKE A PINK
10340039 PILLOW ON ON THE TABLE SOME ROUND PILLOW AND THEY SAID ALL RIGHT NOW GET YOURSELF UP ON THE TABLE AND I WAS ALREADY VERY WOOZY BUT THIS POINT AND I WAS LIKE I KNOW A BIGGER GUY
10340040 YOU KNOW BUT LIKE THERE'S FOUR IF YOU HEAR LIKE CAN YOU HELP ME OUT LIKE JUST THINKING AND THEN IT'S LIKE I PUT YOUR HEAD IN THE PILLOW AND NOW WE'RE GONNA BEGIN BUT AS SOON AS THAT WE'RE GONNA BEGIN AND PUT THE
10340041 MASK OVER MY FACE I WAS JUST OUT EYES OUT AND THEN I WOKE UP A COUPLE HOURS LATER JUST EVERYTHING
10340042 RINGING A LOT OF PAIN DON'T THINK I'VE EVEN GOT OUT OF THE BED UNTIL THE NEXT MORNING 
10340043 I WAS WELL I WOKE UP IN THE WAITING ROOM AND THEY BROUGHT ME UP TO THE ROOM FOR THE NIGHT MAYBE I GUESS THEY'D SHIPPED ME FROM THE GURNEY TO AN ACTUAL BED I DON'T REMEMBER THAT PART EVEN AND IT WASN'T UNTIL
10340044 SOMETIME MAYBE SEVEN O'CLOCK IN THE MORNING WERE ACTUALLY GOT UP TO USE THE RESTROOM FOR THE FIRST TIME I REMEMBER THE STRUGGLE LIKE ACTUALLY GETTING UP AND GETTING OVER TO THE 
10340045 RESTROOM AND YOU KNOW BE LIKE I'LL HANDLE IT MYSELF LIKE LET ME GIVE THIS A SHOT AND HOW DIFFICULT THAT WAS YEAH WE DID NOT EXPECT THAT 
10340046 HE WAS VARIABLE AS THEY YOU KNOW CHANGED THE THE DRUGS I WAS RECEIVING IN THE IV SO INITIALLY I WAS IN QUITE A BIT OF PAIN
10340047 I LET THEM KNOW THAT YOU KNOW IT WAS YES EIGHT OR NINE ON YOUR YOU KNOW YOUR GENERAL OUT OF TEN SCALE RIGHT I THINK THE PAIN HAD ACTUALLY GOTTEN WORSE BY THE TIME I LEFT JUST BECAUSE OF THE REDUCTION
10340048 IN THE DRUG LOAD YEAH I HAD THE JP DRAIN RIGHT SO FOR THE NEXT SECTION PORTION THEY 
10340049 PUT A JP DRAIN WITH THE THE TUBE COMING UP TO HERE AND THEN I WORE THAT AROUND MY NECK THE NEXT FIVE OR SIX DAYS WAS MY BLING RIGHT
10340050 GETTING TO EMPTY IT I GUESS TWICE A DAY OR SO MEASURING THE FLUID THAT CAME OUT AND AFTER A FEW DAYS THE FLUID WAS A CLEAR ENOUGH AND THE VOLUME HAD REDUCED ENOUGH
10340051 THAT I WAS ABLE TO GET IT OUT SO I REMEMBER GETTING IN THE CAR WITH MY MOM DRIVING BACK UP TO HOPKINS BALTIMORE AND MEETING WITH THE 
10340052 NURSE ON HAND WHO'S GONNA BE ACTUALLY REMOVING IT IT'S WASN'T A MAJOR THING IT'S JUST YOU KNOW ONE TUGGING IS DONE IT WAS A YOU KNOW THAT WAS A MILD YOU KNOW
10340053 A BRIEF AND UNEXPECTED SENSATION AS I CAME OUT AND I WAS AMAZED TO EVEN FIT SUCH A LARGE VALVE IN SUCH A SMALL HOLE 
10340054 BY I GUESS MAYBE THE TWO WEEK MARK THE PAIN HAD GONE DOWN SIGNIFICANTLY SO THAT THAT WAS FINE WITHIN SEVERAL DAYS BUT JUST
10340055 THE ENERGY LEVELS AND THE ABILITY TO BE LIKE AWAKE YOU KNOW FOR MORE THAN TWELVE HOURS A DAY JUST THAT TOOK SEVERAL WEEKS TO RECOVER AND IT WAS QUITE A LOT OF DAMAGE
10340056 BOTH WITH GOT SICK TO ME REDUCING YOUR ABILITY TO EAT AND ACTUALLY GET THE NUTRIENTS YOU NEED TO RECOVER THEN ALSO JUST THE SIZE OF
10340057 THE INCISION THE NECK DISSECTION JUST TOOK A WHILE YOU WILL GET BETTER
10340058 THIS TAKES TIME BE PATIENT YOU KNOW I REMEMBER BEING KIND OF UPSET AFTER SURGERY AND THEY'RE LIKE YOU GO IN YOU'RE LIKE THIS WILL
10340059 CURE ME AND THEN WHEN YOU COME OUT I FELT SO MUCH WORSE THAN WHEN I WENT IN RIGHT BECAUSE YOU KNOW THE TUMOR IT DOESN'T ACTUALLY DO ANYTHING TO YOU JUST AS A
10340060 LITTLE LUMP ON YOUR TONGUE IT DOESN'T DOESN'T HAVE ANY IMPACT UNTIL IT'S METASTASIZED AND GONE AND IT'S BRINGING DOWN EVERY CRITICAL SYSTEM IN YOUR BODY RIGHT I JUST REMEMBER OF 
10340061 BEFOREHAND I FELT YOU KNOW ACTUALLY FINE AND THEN AFTER IT WAS JUST COULDN'T DO ANYTHING FOR FOUR WEEKS ON IT BUT THAT DID IMPROVE SLOWLY 
10340062 OH YEAH I DROPPED ABOUT WHAT TEN OR TWELVE POUNDS IN THE FIRST WEEK AT LEAST AFTER ABOUT A DAY OR SO I WAS ABLE TO DRANK SOME
10340063 SOME COOL BROTH ONCE AGAIN AT HIGH TEMPERATURE WOULD HAVE BEEN AWFUL RIGHT BUT AT LEAST THAT COLDER THAT WAS THAT WORKED BY 
10340064 MAYBE DAY FOUR I WAS IN A DIET OF APPLESAUCE AND BROTH AND THEN BY DAY SEVEN I WAS ON A DIET OF APPLESAUCE BROTH AND MILKSHAKES
10340065 YEAH IT WAS MAYBE AFTER ABOUT TWO OR THREE WEEKS SO THAT I COULD HAVE SOME SOFTER FOODS 
10340066 LOTS OF BAKED BEANS SALMON VERY VERY TENDER COOKED CHICKEN YEAH NO DIFFICULTY WITH TASTE BUT MY 
10340067 TONGUE WAS VERY NUMB FOR THE FIRST FEW WEEKS AND EVEN TODAY IT DOES FEEL STRANGE LIKE EVERY TIME I SPEAK I CAN STILL TELL THAT THERE IS A A VERY
10340068 CLEAR IMBALANCE FROM THE LEFT AND THE RIGHT SIDE RIGHT I ROUTINELY BITE MY TONGUE YEAH I KIND OF HAVE A LITTLE BIT LESS KNOWLEDGE FOR WHERE IT IS IN MY MOUTH 
10340069 AND IT'S SURPRISING TOO THAT I BITE IT SO OFTEN BECAUSE THERE'S LESS OF IT THERE TO BITE BUT YEAH 
10340070 I DID GO BACK TO HOPKINS TO MEET WITH A SPEECH PATHOLOGIST FOR A COUPLE OF MEETINGS AND SHE'D GIVE ME SOME EXERCISES TO HELP WITH TONGUE MOBILITY FORTUNATELY BECAUSE OF THE
10340071 RATHER SMALL AREA THAT WAS RESECTED YOU KNOW I DON'T HAVE MANY LONG-TERM IMPACTS ON SPEECH RIGHT I CAN I CAN ENUNCIATE ABOUT IT AS GOOD AS I USED TO 
10340072 MY MOM STILL TELLS ME SHE CAN TELL THE DIFFERENCE RIGHT BUT THAT'S YOU KNOW YOUR MOM I'VE ALSO SEEN A PHYSICAL THERAPIST THERE'S A WHOLE
10340073 HOST OF EXERCISES AHEAD TO DO THEY'RE MOSTLY TO REGAIN THE NECK MOBILITY AND THE SHOULDER MOBILITY 
10340074 I'M NOT SURE YOU EVER FEEL PERFECTLY NORMAL AGAIN IT'S ONE OF THOSE THINGS SO IT'S LIKE THIS IS A RATHER LARGE AND UNEXPECTED CHANGE 
10340075 AND THEN IT IT CHANGES YOUR OUTLOOK FROM THERE ON RIGHT JUST THE THINGS YOU VALUE AND WHAT YOU CARE ABOUT
10340076 AND WHAT YOU PRETTY NO LONGER TOLERATE AND THE KINDS OF NONSENSE YOU WON'T WASTE YOUR TIME ON ONCE YOU'VE COME SO CLOSE TO
10340077 LOSING EVERYTHING YEAH SO KIND OF PSYCHOLOGICALLY EMOTIONALLY PERSONALLY I'M NOT SURE THAT YOU EVER GET BACK TO WHAT WAS NORMAL
10340078 BUT PRETTY SOON YOU KIND OF FEEL LIKE THIS IS WHO I AM NOW AND YOU BECOME OKAY WITH THAT PHYSICALLY
10340079 IT WAS A FEW MONTHS I STILL HAVE PLENTY OF REHAB TO DO AFTER SURGERY A ABSOLUTELY CRITICAL YEAH I WOULD NOT 
10340080 HAVE ANOTHER DO ANYTHING FOR MYSELF THE FIRST TWO WEEKS AFTER SURGERY I HAVE MY PARENTS WITH ME ONE OF THEM AT EVERY EVERY POINT IN TIME IMMEDIATELY POST-OP 
10340081 I'M LUCKY ENOUGH TO LIVE STILL NEARBY WHERE I GREW UP SO I NEED TO HAVE PARENTS YOU KNOW WHO DO CARE AND WHO WOULD BE THERE FOR ME 
10340082 WORRYING VERY WORRYING YEAH EVERY TIME THIS KIND OF AN ALL OR NOTHING MAKE IT OR BREAK IT EVENT
10340083 RIGHT THIS COULD BE THE TIME WHERE I FIND OUT THAT OH I ACTUALLY DO HAVE CANCER AGAIN RIGHT YOU KNOW THEY TAKE YOUR YOUR WEIGHT AND YOUR BLOOD PRESSURE AND YOUR TEMPERATURE EVERY TIME YOU COME IN
10340084 TO THE HOSPITAL RIGHT AND MY BLOOD PRESSURE IS ROUTINELY LIKE THIRTY POINTS HIGHER EVERY TIME BEFORE AN ONCOLOGY APPOINTMENT THAN IT IS WHENEVER I SEE A REGULAR DOCTOR 
10340085 YEAH BUT LUCKILY THAT IT DIDN'T DIDN'T COME BACK IT'S BEEN TWO YEARS NOW THE LAST LAST CHECKUP
10340086 TWO YEAR ONE WITH THAT BEING A BENCHMARK WAS PARTICULARLY NERVE WRACKING I DO FEEL LIKE FROM NOW ON IT WILL BE JUST MORE MORE ACTUALLY ROUTINE RIGHT
10340087 MORE LIKE THIS IS JUST A PART OF MY BIANNUAL OR ANNUAL MAINTENANCE IT'S REALLY NOT LIKELY TO MOUNT ANYTHING I JUST DO THIS TO MAKE SURE I STAY HEALTHY 
10340088 WHEREAS BEFORE THIS IS YOU KNOW IT WAS MORE TO MAKE SURE THAT I AM HEALTHY THAT I DON'T ACTUALLY LIKE I DON'T CURRENTLY HAVE CANCER AND ME STILL AND IT DIDN'T
10340089 COME BACK HE DIDN'T RELAPSE THERE'S REALLY NO GOOD TIME TO GET A DIAGNOSIS LIKE THIS RIGHT BUT THIS IS PROBABLY THE BEST
10340090 POSSIBLE TIME YOU COULD EVER GET ONE THING I'M THINKING ABOUT THE TREATMENTS ARE AVAILABLE NOW AS OPPOSED TO EVEN DECADES AGO THAT THERE THERE ARE TREATMENTS
10340091 RIGHT THOUSANDS YEARS AGO NOTHING HUNDRED YEARS AGO NOTHING EVEN DECADES AGO THEY'RE WORK IT REALLY NEED VIABLE TREATMENTS THAT HAD A HIGH SUCCESS RATE 
10340092 WITH YOU KNOW MINIMAL OR LOW COMPLICATIONS WHEREAS NOW THERE THERE ARE GOOD ODDS DEFINITELY STICK WITH WHATEVER YOUR DOCTORS 
10340093 RECOMMEND THEIR PHYSICAL THERAPY DOCTORS OR YOUR MEDICAL PRACTITIONERS BE SURE YOU JUST FOLLOW ALL THEIR ADVICE HELP YOUR RECOVERY GO SMOOTHER
