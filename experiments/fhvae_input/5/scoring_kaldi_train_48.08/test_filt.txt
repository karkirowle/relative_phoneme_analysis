ocancer10050002 HALF OF MY TONGUE REMOVED THAT WAS MY THIRTEENTH SURGERY ALTHOUGH I HAD NUMEROUS SURGERIES AT A CASUAL PACE SINCE BEING DIAGNOSED WITH CANCER IN TWO THOUSAND EIGHT SOMETHING HAD CHANGED
ocancer10050003 CANCER HAD MORPHED INTO A FAST-GROWING AGGRESSIVE CANCER IT HAD TO BE REMOVED QUICKLY WITH SAFE MARGINS IN ORDER TO SAVE MY LIFE DURING THE SURGERY IT BECAME APPARENT THAT CANCER CELLS HAVE SPREAD TO MY LYMPH NODES
ocancer10050004 CAUSING ONE TO BURST LIKE A LIKE A SQUISHED BLUEBERRY AT LEAST THATS HOW MANY SURGEONS DESCRIBED IT AFTER THE SURGERY HAD TO HAPPEN IN SPECIAL SIX WEEKS OF HIGH DOSE CHEMO
ocancer10050005 THERAPY AND THIRTY RADIATION SESSIONS WHICH WORK TOGETHER TO DESTROY THE RESIDUAL CANCER IN MY BODY BUT IT ALSO DESTROYED THE WHITE BLOOD CELL COUNT PRETTY MUCH TO UNDETECTABLE LEVELS WHITE BLOOD
ocancer10050006 CELLS WITH SPECIAL ANGRY LITTLE CELLS THAT HELP THE FIGHT TO KEEP YOU WELL IN HINDSIGHT IT WAS A STUPID IDEA BUT I ALWAYS WANTED TO TRAVEL TO CONSUMER ELECTRONICS SHOW IN LAS VEGAS NEVADA SO WITH A FRIEND JUST
ocancer10050007 WEEKS AFTER MY TREATMENT WAS OVER I WENT TO VEGAS I WAS FLYING IN AN AIRPLANE REBREATHING AIR FULL OF BACTERIA AND VIRUSES THEN ABANDONED A VEGAS IT SPENDS A FEW DAYS WITH A HALF A MILLION PEOPLE FROM ALL OVER THE WORLD
ocancer10050008 I CONTINUALLY HAD TO RETURN THE TRUNK OF OUR RENTAL CAR WHERE WAS A BIG SYRINGE TO SQUEEZE ANOTHER CAN OF FORMULA INTO MY ABDOMINAL TUBE AND RUSHED BACK TO FIGHT THE CROWDS TO SEE THE VARIOUS EXHIBITS ON TECHNOLOGY
ocancer10050009 TO MAKE A LONG STORY SHORT AFTER RETURNING FROM MY TRIP I WAS FOUND THE NEXT MORNING UNDER THE COVERAGE REBREATHING MY OWN AIR I WAS IN COMPLETE RIGOR NON RESPONSIVE BARELY BREATHING
ocancer10050010 THE MEDS HAD TO INTUBATE ME AND GET TO ME THE ICU RIGHT AWAY I WOKE UP A DAY AND A HALF LATER BUT TUBES CAME OUT OF MY THROAT A DOZEN BAGS OF A VARIOUS FLUIDS AND ANTIBIOTICS COMING BY IV
ocancer10050011 DRIP THEY HAD FOUND THAT I HAD PNEUMONIA RESPIRATORY FAILURE AND SYSTEMIC SEPSIS ALL AT THE SAME TIME THAT VERY WEEK MY DAUGHTER'S FRIEND HAD A FATHER THAT DIED IN JUST ONE OF THOSE CONDITIONS
ocancer10050012 AND ALL THREE ACTUALLY COULD HAVE KILLED ME I DON'T KNOW ABOUT YOU WHETHER OR NOT YOU'RE A SPIRITUAL OR RELIGIOUS PERSON BUT MY FRIENDS AND FAMILY THEY PRAYED FERVENTLY FOR ME DURING THE WHOLE PERIOD
ocancer10050013 I'M PERSONALLY NOT A RELIGIOUS MAN I DO GIVE JESUS A CREDIT FOR THIS I DON'T DESERVE TO BE ALIVE I BELIEVE I JUST GETTING A SECOND CHANCE A THIRD CHANCE RELIEF IF WE ARE COUNTING
ocancer10050014 AFTER THE EVENTS I'VE GONE THROUGH THERE ARE SEVERAL KEY TAKEAWAYS THAT I'VE LEARNED NUMBER ONE EVERYBODY DIES BUT NOT EVERYBODY TRULY LIVES NUMBER TWO RATHER THAN WALL

ocancer10050016 DIRECTIONS THAT WE NEVER FORESAW BUT THE PAIN WE FEEL IS THE UNEXPECTED OUTCOMES AND THAT FEELING OF LOSS NUMBER FOUR DON'T LET LIFE GET IN THE WAY OF LIVING IF YOU HAVE BREATH PRESS

ocancer10050019 FAR DIFFERENT AND SPEAKING CLEARLY ENOUGH FOR PEOPLE TO UNDERSTAND WHAT YOU'RE SAYING YOU KNOW IT'D BE EASY TO LOOK AT WHAT I DON'T HAVE I DON'T HAVE TWO WORKING VOCAL CORDS I JUST HAVE ONE THAT WORKS

ocancer10130001 HI I'M ROBERT HAASE AND YOU MAY HAVE KNOWN MY STORY SO FAR BUT IF YOU HAVEN'T I WANT TO GIVE AN UPDATE EIGHT MONTHS AGO
ocancer10130002 ON OCTOBER THIRD TWO THOUSAND THIRTEEN I HAD HALF MY TONGUE REMOVED DUE TO FAST GROWING CANCER AND A TUMOR THAT HAD GOT OUT OF CONTROL THEY TOOK THE LEFT HALF
ocancer10130003 AND THEY REPLACED THAT PART OF MY TONGUE WITH PART OF MY ARM AND YOU KNOW MY ARM SHOWS UP AND THE TONGUE IS PRETTY MUCH HEALED FOR THE MOST PART BUT I'M STRONGER GOING THAT THAT PROCESS OF
ocancer10130004 HEALING I'M STILL EYES WERE PAIN BUT NOWHERE NEAR AS MUCH AS I HAD YOU KNOW I BRUSHED MY TEETH AT NIGHT AND MY GUM STOVE THERE'S STILL BLOOD IN THE SINK IT'S JUST
ocancer10130005 STILL HEALING FROM THAT BUT WHEN THE PROCESS OF TESTING MYSELF THEY WERE DOING A BIOPSY AND TOOK OUT A VERY LARGE
ocancer10130006 CHUNK OF TISSUE AT THE BASE OF MY MOUTH AND THAT IS WHAT'S NOT HEALING WHATSOEVER AND THE REASON WAS IS THE TISSUES IN MY TONGUE DON'T HAVE AS MUCH VASCULARITY
ocancer10130007 IS VERY FEW BLOOD VESSELS BY COMPARISON TO WHAT YOUR TONGUE WOULD BE LIKE AND SO IT WASN'T HEALING SO IN RESPONSE THEY DECIDED TO HYPERBARIC CHAMBER TREATMENTS AND I
ocancer10130008 AT THE END OF NEXT WEEK I'VE HAD FORTY FIVE NINETY MINUTE HYPERBARIC TREATMENTS I WENT FROM HAVING PAIN DAILY WHERE I WAS JUST BREAKING INTO
ocancer10130009 TEARS FROM THE PAIN BEING SO OVERWHELMING TO PRETTY MUCH HAVING VERY FEW PAIN MEDS RIGHT NOW AT ALL ACTUALLY ABOUT THREE PILLS A DAY
ocancer10130010 AND SO I'VE HAD ABOUT EIGHT PERCENT REDUCTION IN PAIN MEDICATIONS AND I'M REALLY REALLY HEALING PRETTY WELL SO THAT'S BEEN PRETTY AMAZING I WAS TOLD BACK AT THE END OF MY CHEMOTHERAPY
ocancer10130011 AND RADIATION BACK IN DECEMBER THAT YOU KNOW MY TASTE IS GONE AT THAT POINT AND I WAS TOLD BY JUNE I HAVE MY TASTE BACK IT'S NOT
ocancer10130012 I GUESS A HUNDRED FIFTY FIVE POUNDS WHICH IS A LEAST I'VE BEEN SINCE JUNIOR HIGH AND NOW I'M NOT GETTING MY WEIGHT BACK AT ALL AND I'M EATING A LOT
ocancer10130013 I HAVE ICE CREAM PRETTY MUCH EVERY DAY I KNOW THOSE OF YOU WHO THINKS IT'S DANGEROUS AND IT CAUSES CANCER I APOLOGIZE TO YOU BUT I HAVE FOOD A LOT OF IT EVERY DAY MORE THAN I THINK
ocancer10130014 I CAN POSSIBLY EAT AND I'M STILL NOT GAINING WEIGHT SO SOMEHOW MY METABOLISM CHANGED AND RESET I DON'T RECOMMEND THIS AS A PROCESS FOR LOSING WEIGHT CANCER DIET BUT THE
ocancer10130015 BUT IT DOES SEEM TO WORK FOR ME BUT THAT DECREASE IN TASTE IS MAKING IT HARD TO EAT IN GENERAL YOU CAN TASTE SOME SALT AND BUT NO SWEETS AT ALL
ocancer10130016 I'M DOING A CAT SCAN NEXT WEEK MY CT SCAN THE CAT SCAN IS GOING TO BE NEXT TUESDAY AND THEY'RE LOOKING FOR CANCER
ocancer10130017 THEY WANT TO SEE THEY'RE GOING BEYOND THE PET SCAN AND LOOKING MORE SPECIFICALLY THROUGHOUT MY UPPER TORSO TO SEE IF THERE'S ANY CANCER IN MY BODY STILL LAST TEST I HAD
ocancer10130018 THE TISSUES ON MY MOUTH SPECIFICALLY WHAT WAS CANCER FREE AND WHICH IS AMAZING SO THAT'S AWESOME BUT THE CAT SCAN DIDN'T GIVE MORE SPECIFIC RESULTS AND SO I'M LOOKING
ocancer10130019 FORWARD TO HEARING TO SAFE FROM THAT BUT I JUST WANT TO THANK ALL MY FRIENDS OUT THERE MY SUPPORTERS AND THOSE WHO FOLLOWED ME THROUGH THIS PROCESS AND I'M JUST I'M SO BLESSED TO HAVE YOU
ocancer10130020 AND YOU KNOW YOU'VE BEEN JUST PUSHING ME AND SUPPORTING ME AND I KNOW IT MANY OF YOU THINK OF YOU'RE ON BEYOND TO CALL BEYOND WHAT I SHOULD BE DOING AND LOOK AT MY WEBSITES AND MY BUSINESS I'VE
ocancer10130021 SCHEDULED MYSELF TEN SEMINARS THIS FALL EVERYTHING FROM WAIKIKI BEACH IN HAWAII TO ATLANTA IN GEORGIA ON THE EAST COAST AND EVERYWHERE
ocancer10130022 BETWEEN AND FROM TEXAS TO THE MIDWEST AND ALL THROUGHOUT WASHINGTON STATE AND IN OREGON I'M JUST EXCITED TO GET BACK TO WORK AND
ocancer10130023 I DON'T SPEAK THE WAY I USED TO THIS IS NOT THE VOICE I WOULD HAVE CHOSEN BUT IT'S THE VOICE THAT I'VE BEEN GIVEN I'M LOOKING FORWARD TO USING THAT VOICE TO MAKE A DIFFERENCE IN MY FIELD AS
ocancer10130024 WELL AS TO ENCOURAGE OTHERS SO THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR YOUR PRAYERS AND SUPPORT AND YOUR LOVE IT'S BEEN AN AMAZING JOURNEY AND IT'S NOT OVER WITH YET SO THANKS FOR SEARCHING WITH ME I'LL TALK TO YOU SOON
ocancer10130025
ocancer10180001 THANK YOU SO MUCH LINDA I AM BOTH HONORED AND PRIVILEGED TO STAND BEFORE YOU TODAY MAKING MY DEBUT SPEECH AS AN ORAL CANCER SURVIVOR MY JOURNEY WITH ORAL CANCER STARTED IN FEBRUARY OF 2015
ocancer10180002 I MADE A NEW PATIENT EXAM AT A LOCAL DENTIST WE HAD MOVED TO TOWN RELOCATED AND PART OF MY NEW PATIENT EXAM WAS TO HAVE A PANORAMIC
ocancer10180003 AND ALSO TO HAVE AN ORAL CANCER SCREENING MY DENTISTS AT THAT TIME NOTICED THAT I HAD A DARK SPOT ON THE PANORAMIC THAT WAS BELOW THE GUM LINES THAT SHE REALLY COULDN'T
ocancer10180004 IDENTIFY SHE TOOK ME BACK AND DID AN ADDITIONAL 25 X-RAYS FREE OF CHARGE TOLD ME TAKE THESE TO THE ORAL SURGEON HELP LOCATE THE MASS AND SEE WHAT YOU'RE DEALING WITH
ocancer10180005 AND I TOOK THOSE TO THE ORAL SURGEON AND WE LOOKED AND GOT A BETTER IMAGING AND AT THAT POINT YOU MUST REALIZE I WAS THIRTY-FIVE YEAR OLD FEMALE MOTHER OF TWO
ocancer10180006 I HAVE AN EIGHT-YEAR-OLD DAUGHTER AND A ONE-YEAR-OLD SON HEALTHY I HAD NO SIGN NO SYMPTOMS NO PAIN THERE WAS NO SYMPTOMS OR ANY CLUES
ocancer10180007 THAT WOULD LEAD YOU TO THINK THAT THIS WOULD BE THE CASE WE TOOK BETTER IMAGING AT THE ORAL SURGEON AND THEY REALIZED MY MASS WAS THE SIZE OF A GOLF BALL GROWING INSIDE MY RIGHT MANDIBLE
ocancer10180008 SLOWLY SEPARATING MY JAWS IT WAS EVENTUALLY GOING TO BREAK IT SO AT THAT POINT WE TOOK A A WISDOM TOOTH DID A BIOPSY AND SENT IT OFF TO BE HAVE A BIOPSY
ocancer10180009 AND TWO WEEKS LATER THE RESULTS CAME IN WE ALL WENT MY HUSBAND AND I SCARED TO DEATH GOT THE BEST NEWS EVER HE SAID YOU'RE CANCER-FREE
ocancer10180010 IT'S WONDERFUL WE JUST NEED TO SEND YOU DOWN TO MU SC AND YOU NEED TO HAVE IT REMOVED BECAUSE OF THE SIZE AND LOCATION IT'S JUST TOO LARGE FOR ME TO DO IN THE OFFICE SO TWO WEEKS LATER
ocancer10180011 AGAIN WE WENT IN FOR THE AND THE HEAD OF THE DENTAL PRACTICE WALKED IN AND SAID I KNOW YOU'RE WORRIED ABOUT YOUR PATHOLOGY I SAID NO THIS GUY THAT GUY RIGHT THERE SAID EVERYTHING WAS FINE
ocancer10180012 AND HE SAID ACTUALLY IT REACTED POORLY WITH THE K-19 DYE AND WE'VE NEVER SEEN THIS BEFORE WE NEED TO READ BIOPSY BUT LET'S GO AHEAD TAKE IT OUT AS A MASS IN WHOLE
ocancer10180013 BIOPSY THE WHOLE SURFACE AND THEN DEAL FROM THERE SO WE WENT IN AND HAD IT REMOVED AND THEY TOLD MY HUSBAND IT WAS CLEAR THERE WAS NO NODULES THAT LOOKED VERY FINE
ocancer10180014 AND THERE SHOULDN'T BE ANYTHING TO WORRY ABOUT ANOTHER TWO WEEKS PASSED WE GOT THE PATHOLOGY REPORT HAD OUR APPOINTMENT DROVE TO CHARLESTON WHICH IS ABOUT A FOUR-HOUR DRIVE FROM CHARLOTTE THAT'S WHERE ALL MY DOCTORS ARE
ocancer10180015 AND WE WERE SITTING THERE AND I TOOK MY CHILDREN MY ONE-YEAR-OLD SON MY EIGHT-YEAR-OLD DAUGHTER AND NINE DOCTORS WALKED IN THE ROOM AND I JUST KNEW AT THAT MOMENT
ocancer10180016 THIS POINT WAS NOT GOING THE WAY WE THOUGHT IT WAS GONNA GO SO I REMEMBER SITTING THERE STARING AT MY CHILDREN AS THE WORDS CAME OUT OF THE DOCTORS MOUTHS THEY SAID WE'VE NEVER SEEN
ocancer10180017 THIS TYPE OF CANCER BEFORE WE DON'T KNOW HOW TO TREAT IT CHEMO AND RADIATION AREN'T EFFECTIVE ON IT THERE'S LESS THAN 80 CASES IN THE WHOLE ENTIRE WORLD SINCE IT WAS DERIVED
ocancer10180018 IN THE 80S I THOUGHT I SAID WHAT AM I SUPPOSED TO DO I WALKED OUT BY ANIMAL AND YOU'LL WANT TO GO FIRST THING I DID I TRIED TO WEBMD MYSELF INTO A DIFFERENT DIAGNOSIS
ocancer10180019 BUT THERE WAS NO INFORMATION NO RESEARCH NO STUDIES EVERYTHING WAS IN THE EARLY 80S AND IT WAS IN THIRD WORLD COUNTRIES IT METASTASIZED INTO
ocancer10180020 LUNG CANCER AND THE THE TRUTH AND THE HARSH REALITY BEHIND IT IS IS THERE'S NOT ANY SURVIVORS BECAUSE IT KILLS US WITHIN FIVE YEARS SO THE OFFICIAL DIAGNOSIS WAS CLEAR CELL
ocancer10180021 ANDROGENICAL CARCINOMA AND I WAS TOLD AT THAT TIME I WAS THE ONLY PERSON IN THE WORLD WITH THIS CANCER I LEFT THERE WITH NOWHERE TO TURN
ocancer10180022 NOBODY TO TALK TO THERE WASN'T A SUPPORT GROUP THERE WASN'T A FOUNDATION THERE WASN'T ANYTHING THAT COULD HELP ME SO FOR A MONTH MY HUSBAND AND I RESEARCHED THE BEST TO
ocancer10180023 OUR ABILITIES ON OUR OWN WE BOUGHT ALL THE CASE STUDIES FROM BACK IN THE DAY READ THEM NO KNOWN SURVIVORS AND REALLY DEALT WITH WHAT WAS FACING US AND ALAN
ocancer10180024 WHIM I DECIDED TO MAKE A GOFUNDME PAGE REALLY DIDN'T RAISE ANY MONEY BUT WITHIN 24 HOURS OF IT GOING VIRAL AND SOCIAL MEDIA I HAD AN EMAIL IN MY INBOX
ocancer10180025 FROM LINDA MILES AND SHE SAID I CAN HELP YOU CALL ME I KNOW WHAT TO DO AND NOT KNOWING LINDA OR OF ORAL CANCER CAUSE OR REALLY ANY FOUNDATION
ocancer10180026 THAT COULD HELP IN ANY WAY I REACHED OUT AND I CONTACTED HER AND SHE CONNECTED ME WITH A WOMAN WHO HAD BEEN IN SAN ANTONIO WHO HAD HAD A JAW REPLACEMENT AND KNEW THE TYPE OF SURGERY THAT I WAS FACING
ocancer10180027 THINGS LIKE THAT THEN SHE ALSO MENTIONED YOU KNOW I'VE HEARD OF THIS CANCER BEFORE I SAID EXCUSE ME SHE SAID WE HELPED ANOTHER FAMILY LAST YEAR SAME DIAGNOSIS
ocancer10180028 I SAID ARE YOU SERIOUS AND WITHIN THE SAME DAY I WAS ON THE PHONE WITH THE ONLY OTHER KNOWN SURVIVOR WITH THIS TYPE OF CANCER I SMILED I CALL MY CANCER BROTHER
ocancer10180029 AND WE ARE IMMEDIATE FAMILY THERE'S NO KNOWN ROUTE TO WHY WE HAVE THIS DISEASE THERE'S NOT IT WAS AN ENVIRONMENTAL IT'S NOT HEREDITARY THERE'S NO WAY TO STOP IT
ocancer10180030 IT'S 95 PERCENT AGGRESSIVE HE'S BEEN DIAGNOSED FOR THREE YEARS ON HIS SECOND REOCCURRENCE ALREADY AT THIS POINT JUST FINISHED HIS LAST SURGERY YES TWO WEEKS AGO
ocancer10180031 AND HE'S IN RECOVERY SO THE HARSH REALITY IS IS WE HAVE TO CHECK FOR ORAL CANCER WE HAVE TO BE DOING SCREENINGS MY CANCER WAS RARE UNDER THE TISSUE MAY NOT HAVE BEEN NOTICED
ocancer10180032 BUT I HAD A DENTIST WHO PAID ATTENTION TO THAT IMAGING AND SAW A TINY LITTLE DARK SPOT THAT CHANGED MY LIFE MY CANCER WOULD HAVE KILLED ME WITHIN SIX MONTHS IF I HAD NOT
ocancer10180033 FOUND IT AND SO I'M ONLY ABLE TO STAND HER TODAY BEFORE YOU BECAUSE OF A DENTIST WHO DID THEIR JOB AND WENT ABOVE THE STANDARD CARE PRACTICE AND BECAUSE OF
ocancer10180034 THE ORAL CANCER PAUSE AND THE WORK THAT THEY DO THEY SENT US A CHECK WHICH ALLOWED ME TO PUT MY SON IN DAYCARE I DIDN'T KNOW THAT THIS THAT YOU SEE NOW
ocancer10180035 MY TISSUE WAS ACTUALLY BONE AND TISSUE TAKEN FROM MY SCAPULA TO REPLACE IN HERE ALONG WITH A TITANIUM PLATE BUT TO LOOK AT MY ONE-YEAR-OLD SON AND KNOW THAT I WAS GOING TO GO THROUGH A RECOVERY
ocancer10180036 AND NOT BE ABLE TO PICK HIM UP AND CARRY HIM I DIDN'T KNOW WHAT TO DO THEY GAVE ME THE OPPORTUNITY TO PUT HIM IN DAY CARE AND CARE FOR HIM WHILE I WENT THROUGH RECOVERY AND THAT IS SOMETHING THAT I COULD NEVER PAY
ocancer10180037 THESE LADIES BACK FOR SO IF YOU HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY TO SUPPORT A FOUNDATION THEY DO WONDERFUL WORK
ocancer10220001 ON OCTOBER THIRD OF TWO THOUSAND FIFTEEN DOCTOR STEVEN BALES OF VIRGINIA MASON HOSPITAL IN SEATTLE WASHINGTON REMOVED HALF OF MY TONGUE THE LEFT HALF THE PROCEDURE CALLED
ocancer10220002 A HEMIGLOSSECTOMY AND I'M HAPPY TO REPORT THAT FIVE YEARS AND TWO DAYS LATER I AM STILL DANCING WITH NED THEY SAYING NO EVIDENCE OF DISEASE
ocancer10220003 AND I'M STILL CANCER-FREE AND SO I JUST WANT REPORT THAT OUT SO YOU ALL UP TO SPEED IT'S WHAT'S HAPPENING WITH MY MY PROCESS IF YOU FOLLOWED MY STORY YOU'LL KNOW THAT WAS FIRST DIAGNOSED
ocancer10220004 WITH SQUAMOUS CELL CARCINOMA OR TONGUE CANCER IN TWO THOUSAND EIGHT DOCTOR CARL MYERS I REMEMBER THE MORNING HE CALLED ME ON SEPTEMBER TWENTY NINTH AND HE SAID THE
ocancer10220005 BOB I'VE GOT I'VE GOT HARD NEWS HE SAID YOU'VE UH YOU'VE BEEN DIAGNOSED WITH CANCER IT IS INDEED CANCER YOU'VE GOT AND MY HEART SANK AT THAT MOMENT
ocancer10220006 I WAS THINKING LIKE WOW DRIVING TO HAVE A FUTURE IF YOU HAD TOLD ME YOU KNOW TEN YEARS LATER I'D BE STILL HERE DOING WHAT I'M DOING I'M NOT SURE WHAT IT BELIEVES YOU I WAS VERY SCARED AND FRIGHTENED AT THAT POINT
ocancer10220007 YOU KNOW I FINISHED MY CHEMOTHERAPY AND RADIATION THERAPIES IT LEFT ME SOMETHING I WOULD CALL BONUS TIME YOU KNOW THAT THOSE THERAPIES ARE HORRENDOUS BUT YET THEY GIVE YOU EXTRA
ocancer10220008 OPPORTUNITY OF LIFE AND YOU KNOW I'VE BEEN ABLE TO HAVE A CHANCE TO SPEND TIME AND BLESS PEOPLE AND ENCOURAGE THEM AND PEOPLE GOING THROUGH THEIR OWN ADVERSITIES NOT JUST CANCER BUT
ocancer10220009 YOU KNOW IF LOTS OF PEOPLE WHO'VE LOST THEIR JOBS LOST THEIR MARRIAGES LOST SO YOU KNOW THEIR BUSINESS OR THEIR HOME OR YOU KNOW FROM WORST LOST A CHILD AND YOU KNOW
ocancer10220010 ALL OF IT BOILS DOWN TO ONE COMMON WORD AND THAT'S LOSS I LOST HALF MY TONGUE I LOST A LOT OF STUFF BUT THE THE WHOLE IDEA OF A FIRST IS THAT LOST PIECE AND
ocancer10220011 YOU KNOW IS YOU KNOW YOU KNOW I LOST MY MY BUSINESS MY MY HOUSE MY CAR MY WIFE LEFT OUR MARRIAGE
ocancer10220012 AND I GOT CANCER ALL IN A VERY SHORT PERIOD OF TIME AND IT SOUNDS HORRIBLE BUT YET AT THE SAME TIME IS IT'S EASY TO FOCUS ON WHAT WE DON'T HAVE AND NOT FOCUS ON WHAT WE DO
ocancer10220013 HAVE AND THAT THAT AMONG THINGS THAT DID STEAL FROM ME WAS MY INVINCIBILITY YOU KNOW WE THINK WE'RE ALL IMMORTAL WE'RE NOT GONNA DIE WE DON'T THINK ABOUT DEATH WE DON'T WANT TO THINK ABOUT DEATH AND WE
ocancer10220014 BUT BEING FACED WITH THAT I REALIZE WOW I MIGHT DIE SOMEDAY YOU KNOW I KNOW THAT SOUNDS SILLY BUT THAT WAS A HUGE THING FOR ME REALIZED I'M MORTAL
ocancer10220015 AND THIS IS A POSSIBILITY THAT COULD HAPPEN SO BUT BEING ABLE TO CARE FOR FAMILY AND FRIENDS AND STILL BE HERE IT'S A HUGE BLESSING SO THOSE EXTRA
ocancer10220016 YEARS I'VE HAD SO FAR AS THESE LAST FIVE HAVE BEEN I'VE BEEN AWESOME THERE'S A EXPRESSION THAT I'VE HEARD AND YOU'VE PROBABLY HEARD BEFORE THAT IT'S NOT SO MUCH LIFE IS A JOURNEY
ocancer10220017 BUT IT'S NOT A DESTINATION YOU KNOW SO LIFE IS NOT ABOUT GETTING SOMEWHERE OR THE GOALS WE HAVE TO GET SOMEWHERE IT'S ABOUT THAT PROCESS ALONG THE WAY IN TWO THOUSAND FIFTEEN
ocancer10220018 I HAD LOST MY TEACHING ASSISTANT SHERRY WAISHUN AS SHE'VE BEEN TEACHING WITH ME FOR GOSH NINE YEARS TOTAL I THINK AT THAT POINT AND AN AMAZING WOMAN AND A
ocancer10220019 GOOD FRIEND AND SHE WAS TAKEN FROM ME SHE AND HER HUSBAND WERE INVOLVED IN A SPORTING INCIDENT WHERE SHE WAS KILLED TRAGICALLY AND YOU KNOW
ocancer10220020 HUGE LOSS THAT YEAR BUT IN THE SAME TIME THAT YEAR I I MET THE WOMAN I'M MARRIED TO NOW I MET KAREN AND SHE WAS A HUGE BLESSING TO ME SO YOU KNOW LIFE THROWS YOU ALL KINDS OF THINGS AND
ocancer10220021 AND OUR FOCUS IS A HUGE HUGE PIECE OF HOW WE'RE GONNA SUCCEED IN THAT IT'S EASY TO LET THE LOSS AND HARDSHIP WE HAVE
ocancer10220022 IT'S EASY TO FOCUS ON THAT AND HAVE IT JUST KIND OF ENTRAP OUR ENTIRE ATTENTION AND FOCUS NOT WE DON'T HAVE OUR FOCUSING SO MUCH WHAT WE'VE LOST AND WE DON'T HAVE WE FORGET WHAT WE DO HAVE
ocancer10220023 SO MAYBE A PARENT LOST A CHILD AND THEY'RE FORGETTING THE FACT IF YOU HAVE TWO OTHERS THAT THEY'RE NOT SPENDING TIME WITH BECAUSE THEY'RE SO SO FOCUSED ON WHAT THEY DON'T HAVE ANYMORE IN THAT
ocancer10220024 SO I WOULD JUST ENCOURAGE YOU TO FOCUS ON WHAT YOU DO HAVE FOCUS ON THE BLESSINGS IN LIFE AND BLESSINGS ARE COMING YOUR WAY ALONG THAT PROCESS YOU KNOW NOW I HAVE A WIFE THAT LOVES ME DEARLY I'VE GOT
ocancer10220025 THREE DAUGHTERS WHO I JUST LOVE INCREDIBLY I'M VERY PROUD OF THEM I HAVE PARENTS IN THE EIGHTIES WHO ARE THRIVING AND DOING WELL I'M BACK TO TEACHING SEMINARS
ocancer10220026 THAT I LOVE NATIONALLY YOU KNOW I I EVEN HAD TO GO TO EUROPE LAST YEAR AND DRIVE THE AUTOBAHN AND DECREASING FROM HUNDRED HUNDRED AND TWENTY MILES
ocancer10220027 PER HOUR FOR QUITE A WHILE THAT WAS JUST LIKE YOU KNOW A DREAM OF MINE AND I HAD NO IDEA THE AMAZING THINGS THAT WERE GOING TO COME AFTER HAVING CHEMOTHERAPY
ocancer10220028 RADIATION AND THINKING I WAS GOING TO BE GONE SO THE BUSES ARE THERE THE REST IS VIDEOS FOR PEOPLE WHO'VE HAD HEMIGLOSSECTOMY OR
ocancer10220029 ABOUT TO HAVE ONE OR MAYBE FRIENDS AND FAMILY WHO ARE DOING RESEARCH AND TRYING TO SUPPORT SOMEBODY WHO'S GONE THROUGH ONE OR IS ABOUT TO GO THROUGH ONE SO HE WAS SOME INFORMATION SPECIFICS
ocancer10220030 THINGS THAT I'VE BEEN THROUGH THE LAST FIVE YEARS MAYBE HERE'S SOME THINGS YOU MIGHT NOT EXPECT THINGS I WASN'T TOLD THAT MIGHT HAPPEN SO I'LL GO THROUGH THOSE BUT
ocancer10220031 BEFORE I TALK ABOUT THE NEGATIVES AGAIN REGARDLESS WHAT THE NEGATIVE SIDE EFFECTS AND ALL THE STUFF THAT'S BAD THE NUMBER ONE THING IS I'M ALIVE IT'S I'M ALIVE TO EVEN COMPLAIN AND
ocancer10220032 PEOPLE THINK WOW I HAVE ALL THESE PROBLEMS BUT YEAH BUT YOU'RE ALIVE YOU KNOW SO THE DOWNSIDE OF TREATMENT YOU SHOULD LIVE AND THAT'S THE WHOLE POINT OF A TREATMENT IS TO EXTEND THAT LIFE OPPORTUNITY
ocancer10220033 SO SIDE EFFECTS WISE THERE ARE NUMEROUS ONES THAT I'VE HAD ACTUALLY PROBABLY NEARLY ALMOST TWO DOZEN BUT THE BIGGER ONES THAT I HAVE ARE HAVING AN EFFECT
ocancer10220034 BACK THE FIRST ONE WAS A SHOW UP WAS CALLED ORNATE SIGN WHICH IN MY GO FOR A WALK OR SOMETHING EVEN DURING TREATMENT I PUT MY CHIN TO MY CHEST AND IT BE THE SUDDEN SURGE A
ocancer10220035 THE PAINFUL SURGE IN MY LOWER BODY BECAUSE I ALMOST NUMB AND TINGLY AND JUST BECOME A WEAK ALL AT ONCE AND THAT'S SOMETHING THAT CAME SPECIFICALLY BECAUSE I HAD A CHEMOTHERAPY CALLED
ocancer10220036 CISPLATIN WITH CERVICAL RADIATION THAT COMBINATION SOME PEOPLE DOES CAUSE ORNATE SIGN AND SO BE AWARE OF THAT IT'S NOT GONNA
ocancer10220037 KILL ME IT'S JUST NOT FUN ESPECIALLY IF I'M ACTIVE OR SOMETHING I PUT MY CHIN DOWN THAT MIGHT HAPPEN TO ME MY TISSUES WERE WEAKENED CHEMOTHERAPY
ocancer10220038 WEAKENS YOUR TISSUES FOR YEARS AND YEARS TO COME AND I WAS INSTALLING A AIR CONDITIONER THIS LAST SUMMER I WAS HAVING TWENTY FIVE
ocancer10220039 POUND AIR CONDITIONER I WASN'T ASKING FOR HELP LIKE I SHOULD HAVE AND A HEAVY DUTY MOUNT I BOUGHT FROM A LOCAL HOME STORE AND I WAS INSTALLING IT AND THE MOUNT BROKE AND TRY TO
ocancer10220040 CATCH THE AIR CONDITIONER WITH ONE HAND AND IT TORE THREE MUSCLES RUNNING OFF MY SHOULDER AND HAD TO HAVE SURGERY FOR THAT MATTER OF FACT ON THE LAST VIDEOS YOU CAN PROBABLY SEE MY BRACE AND I DIDN'T SAY MUCH ABOUT IT AT THE TIME
ocancer10220041 BUT SO YOUR TISSUES WERE WEAKENED PERMANENTLY AND IT HAD A BIG EFFECT ON ME I HAVE SOMETHING CALLED INTERMITTENT PARESTHESIAS AND THE LEFT SIDE OF MY FACE IF I TURN MY HEAD TO THE LEFT FOR
ocancer10220042 VERY LONG AT ALL THE ENTIRE SIDE OF MY FACE AND NECK TINGLES IT'S KIND OF PAINFUL TINKLING IT BECOMES A NUMB AND IT HURTS SO I DON'T TURN LEFT VERY MUCH SO I STILL
ocancer10220043 DO AND WE'LL TALK ABOUT THAT IN A SECOND BUT ONE OF THE BIGGEST THINGS LATELY THAT HAS HAPPENED PROBABLY THE LAST SIX MONTHS IS A CONDITION CALLED CERVICAL DYSTONIA
ocancer10220044 OR SPASMODIC TORTICOLLIS AND SO YOU MIGHT SEE IT BUT ONCE IN A WHILE WHO ACTUALLY HAVE THE MUSCLES TIGHTEN BECAUSE IT HAS AN ANGLE MINE WANTS TO DO THAT BUT I FIGHT IT
ocancer10220045 AND SO MY MUSCLES ARE CONSTANTLY IN BATTLE THE ANTAGONIST ARE FIGHTING BACK AND FORTH TO KEEP MY NEXT STREET BUT THEY SPASM CONSTANTLY YOU'LL SEE MY MUSCLES JUST POP UP REALLY HARD IN
ocancer10220046 BACK I'VE TRIED THREE ROUNDS OF OF HAVING BOTOX DONE MY NECK AND IT'S A CRAZY EXPENSIVE PROCESS
ocancer10220047 AND IT WEAKENS THE MUSCLE AND DOESN'T ALLOW IT TO FUNCTION AS WELL SO FOR ME THAT MAKES ME NERVOUS I DON'T WANT TO HAVE A WEAK MUSCLES IN MY NECK EXTRA IF I TRIP OR CURB OR SOMETHING I CAN'T SUPPORT MYSELF SO
ocancer10220048 ANYWAY THAT'S WITH THE WEIRD PART IS IS I KNOW YOU CAN'T HAVE THIS BUT IF I HAVE PARKINSON'S IN MY NECK SOMETIMES BECAUSE I'LL GET THESE THESE KIND OF BOBBING
ocancer10220049 MOTIONS WHERE IT'S A RHYTHMIC TREMOR I AS I CAN'T I CAN'T HELP US I PUT MY FINGER IN THERE I'LL BEAT THE MUSCLE UP AND DOES THAT THAT RHYTHMIC PIECE IS VERY ODD
ocancer10220050 BUT AGAIN SIDE EFFECT OF ALL THE TREATMENTS I HAVE NERVES TO GO THROUGH SCAR TISSUE AND ALL THAT MOVEMENT IS AFFECTING THE NECK AS WELL ANYWAY THERE'S MORE PROBLEMS BUT YOU GET THE
ocancer10220051 IDEA SO YOU'RE GONNA HAVE SIDE EFFECTS FROM THAT BUT AGAIN I'M ALIVE I USED TO MAKE THIS VIDEO USED TO TALK TO YOU AND ENCOURAGE PEOPLE SO IT'S IT'S GOOD THEN PEOPLE ASK ME TO SAY YOU KNOW HOW YOU DOING
ocancer10220052 I SMIRK IT'S LIKE SHOULD I COMPLAIN WELL NO IT'S NOT WORTH IT BECAUSE I RATHER TALK ABOUT THE POSITIVE THINGS THAT ARE GOING ON IN MY LIFE
ocancer10220053 FOR THOSE WHO'VE HAD RADIATION AS PART OF YOUR TREATMENT IF YOU'VE HAD HEMIGLOSSECTOMY YOU'VE HAD RADIATION I HAVE SOME EXTRA IDEAS FOR YOU THINGS I THINK ARE IMPORTANT I'VE LEARNED
ocancer10220054 I'VE MET PEOPLE WHO'VE HAD THIS HAVE NOT HAD GOOD ORAL CARE AND IT'S LOST THEIR TEETH OVER THE TEETH OF ROTTING OR FALLING APART SO I WAS BLESSED I
ocancer10220055 HAD SOMEONE EARLY ON A FRIEND I WAS A DENTAL HYGIENIST AND SHE WAS ABLE TO GET ME SOMETHING CALLED A FLUORIDE VARNISH AND I WAS ABLE TO PUT THAT ON MY TEETH ON A FAIRLY REGULAR BASIS IS SOMETHING THAT
ocancer10220056 A DENTIST WOULD DO WITH YOU TWICE A YEAR AS YOU'RE CLEANING PERHAPS BUT WITH THAT FLUORIDE VARNISH DOES IS IT ALLOWS YOU TO ACTUALLY HAVE IT KIND OF SLOWS THE
ocancer10220057 DEMINERALIZATION OF YOUR TEETH IT HELPS TO STRENGTHEN THOSE AND ALSO HELPS TO AVOID DECAY OF THE TEETH AS WELL SO YEAH YOU KNOW FLUORIDE IS A POISON BUT THE SAME TIME AS
ocancer10220058 USED PROPERLY CAN ACTUALLY HELP YOU QUITE A BIT I HAVE MY TEETH CLEAN FOUR TIMES A YEAR AND IT'S TWICE AS OFTEN IS RECOMMENDED BUT WHEN YOU HAVE LACK OF SALIVA AND
ocancer10220059 I HAVE NO SALIVA FUNCTION IN MY MOUTH AT ALL IT ACTUALLY BAD FOR YOUR TEETH AND BED FOR YOUR MOUTH HYGIENE SO I HAVEN'T SEEN FOUR TIMES A YEAR MAKING SURE THAT WAS TAKEN CARE OF PROPERLY
ocancer10220060 AFTER EVERY TIME I EAT ANY FOOD AT ALL I USE A WATER PICK OR OTHER TYPE OF PRODUCTS LIKE THAT I'VE THREE OF THEM ACTUALLY ONE FOR TRAVEL
ocancer10220061 AND ONE IN THE KITCHEN ONE LIKE MY BATHROOM I'VE GONE EVERYWHERE I USE A WATER PICK TO CLEAN THE MOUTH OUT I USE A FLOSSERS STICK I'M FLOSSING THREE OR FOUR TIMES A DAY TO KEEP THAT STUFF OUT
ocancer10220062 OF MY TEETH SO IT CAN'T FORM OF CAVITIES I'M SOMETHING YOU DON'T HAVE A TON MUCH TONGUE FUNCTION YOU CAN'T CLEAN FOOD I'VE YOUR TEETH ANYWAYS SO IT'S WORTHWHILE TO HAVE US IN YOUR IN YOUR POCKET A
ocancer10220063 ANOTHER THING TO THINK ABOUT IS TALKING TO MAYBE A NUTRITIONIST OR TALKING TO SOMEBODY AT A HEALTH FOOD STORE BUT YOU WANT TO GET QUALITY NUTRITION TO BE ABLE TO HAVE
ocancer10220064 YOUR BODY THE ABILITY TO HAVE THE OSTEOBLAST AND SUCH TO BUILD AND AND SUPPORT YOUR BONE FUNCTION AND BONE GROWTH SO YOU ARE LOOK AT HAVING
ocancer10220065 HIGH QUALITY CALCIUMS AND SOMEBODY ABSORB AS WELL IN YOUR SYSTEM YOU WANT TO HAVE SOMETHING TO MAGNESIUM YOU WANT TO HAVE VITAMINS A C AND D ALL THOSE
ocancer10220066 HELP WITH BONES AS WELL AND C'S JUST GOOD FROM A STANDPOINT OF YOU KNOW COLD AND FLU SEASON AND SUCH BUT BUT A BIGGER ONE TOO IS GOING TO BE JUST WORKING A STARCH ISSUE
ocancer10220067 I HAVE A LOT OF STARCH ISSUE IN MY NECK IT'S VERY HARD IF I PULLED UP BUT I CAN ACTUALLY GRIND ON THIS THING AND EVERY DAY I'M DOING WORK ON THIS I'M ACTUALLY MAKING A VIDEO
ocancer10220068 SOON SHOWING YOU SOME SOME SELF CARE AND HOW TO BREAK UP A SCAR TISSUE AND GET MORE RANGE OF MOTION BUT ANYWAY I HOPE THIS VIDEO HAS BEEN HELPFUL
ocancer10220069 I HOPE FOR THOSE WHO'VE HAD THE PAST HEMIGLOSSECTOMY OR PEOPLE WHO WERE FEARFUL FOR FRIENDS AND FAMILY WHO ARE GONNA HAVE ONE OR HAD ONE IT'S GONNA BE OKAY IT'S NOT
ocancer10220070 IT'S NOT FUN IT'S DESTRUCTIVE BUT AT THE SAME TIME AS IT GAVE ME A SECOND CHANCE ON LIFE AND IF I HADN'T HAD THIS DONE I WOULD HAVE BEEN DEAD IN TWO THOUSAND THIRTEEN AND HERE WE ARE
ocancer10220071 TWO THOUSAND EIGHTEEN FIVE YEARS AND A COUPLE DAYS LATER I'M STILL AROUND SO THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR WATCHING AND SEND ME YOUR EMAIL SAYS YOU HAVE BEEN IF YOU HAVE ANY QUESTIONS A
ocancer10220072 I TRY TO GET BACK TO YOU AS MUCH AS I CAN BUT
ocancer10230001 ALL RIGHT WELL HI EVERYONE THIS IS VERY VERY DIFFICULT FOR ME TO DO I DEBATED IT FOR A LONG TIME

ocancer10240030 FAR ABOVE ALL POWER UP AND SUPPLIER EVERY NAMELESS NAME THAT INCLUDES THE NAMELESS CANCER AND THIS TUMOR STARTED ON MY TONGUE
ocancer10240031 I WOULD HAVE A PAIN IN MY EAR MY NECK RIGHT HERE AS WELL MY JAW WHICH TELL ME I STARTED MY TONGUE IS THE WORK OF THE DEVIL
ocancer10240032 HE COMES TO KILL STEAL AND DESTROY BUT CHRIST CAME WE GIVE UP ON ICE AND I KNOW MY INHERITANCE I KNOW
ocancer10240033 THAT JESUS PAID FOR MY HEALING ON THE ON THE CROSS IT'S PART OF MY ATONEMENT PACKAGE IT'S PART OF WHAT HE DID IN THE ATONEMENT IT'S PART OF MY BENEFIT PACKAGE PSALM
ocancer10240034 ONE HUNDRED THREE HE FORGIVES ALL MY SINS AND HEALS ALL MY DISEASES IT ALSO SAYS IN MATTHEW EIGHT SEVENTEEN THAT AFTER HE HEALED HE
ocancer10240035 SAID EVERYONE EVERYONE SAYS THAT'S DOING WHAT WAS SPOKEN BY THE PROPHET ISAIAH THAT HE TOOK OUR SICKNESSES AND CARRIED AWAY OUR PAIN
ocancer10240036 AND ISAIAH IT IT SPEAKS UP THAT AS WELL THAT MATTHEW IS REFERRING TO SO I'VE NO DOUBT ABSOLUTELY ZERO DOUBT IN MY MIND
ocancer10240037 THAT I'M ALREADY YOU KNOW PERSECUTORS WHO TRANSFER WORK SAYS BY WHOSE STRIPES YOU WERE HEALED AND I USED TO QUOTE THIS OVER AND OVER AND OVER AND FOR YEARS
ocancer10240038 AFTER FINDING OUT THE DIAGNOSIS BUT YOU KNOW IT DOESN'T DO ANY GOOD IF IT'S NOT MIXED WITH REAL FAITH YOU CAN'T QUOTE IT ON AND ON AND EXPECT THAT THAT FOR YOUR MIRACLE COMES FROM IT HAS TO COME FROM A DEEP
ocancer10240039 KNOWING INSIDE THAT WE REALLY ARE HEALED AND SOMETIME THAT'S A PROCESS AND FOR ME IT'S A PROCESS BUT I HAD SEVERAL PEOPLE ARE UP TO THAT HAVE BEEN DOWN THIS ROAD MIGHT TEXT
ocancer10240040 I'D BE THE ENGINE WILL MENTION JERRY BASING YOUR GO STREAM ALL THESE PEOPLE AND OTHERS COUNTLESS MORE OUT THERE
ocancer10240041 OBTAIN RECEIVES THE HUMAN HAD ALREADY BEEN PROVIDED AND PAID FOR BECAUSE THEY KNEW THAT WE WERE HEROES AND THEY REFUSED TO LET GO OF THEIR
ocancer10240042 INHERITANCE AND WHAT WAS WHAT WAS RIGHTFULLY THEIRS THEY REFUSED LIKE THE DEVIL TAKE WHAT WAS THEIRS AND THAT TIME THE POINT WHEN I'VE FINALLY COME TO THAT I KNOW HEALING HIS MIND
ocancer10240043 AND I WAS A CHILDREN'S BRAIN AND IT WAS ALREADY PROVIDED ITS ARE YOU THERE IT'S REALLY ARE THERE IN MY SPIRIT MAN AND IT JUST TOOK A LONG TIME FOR ME TO RENEW MY MIND
ocancer10240044 ENOUGH TO GET TO THE POINT WHERE I HAD NO DOUBT ZERO DOUBT ZERO UNBELIEF THAT GOD'S WORD IS TRUE AND WILL NOT RETURN VOID AND I THINK
ocancer10240045 IT'S A PUN GET INTO THAT POINT WHERE SYMPTOMS LIKE THEIR PEAK THE ABSOLUTE WORST POINT THEY HAVE BEEN AT WHERE I WOULD SAY OKAY TIME
ocancer10240046 DOESN'T CHANGE THE WORD AND I HAD AT THAT POINT WAS SO FULLY PERSUADED BY HIS WORD THAT SYMPTOMS NO MATTER HOW BAD THEIR WORK DID NOT MAKE ME
ocancer10240047 DOUBT HIS LORD HIS WORK IT'S THE ONLY THING AND IT'S TRUE AND OUR PHYSICAL SENSES ARE NOT
ocancer10240048 TRUE THERE OF THIS NATURAL PHYSICAL REALM AND I'M NOT ON THIS REALM ANYMORE WHEN I WAS GOING AGAIN I WAS SITTING IN HEAVENLY PLACES AND THAT IS WHERE I AM FROM I AM FROM THAT'S MY SPIRIT THAT'S MY SPIRIT
ocancer10240049 DAYS AND THAT'S WHERE I OPERATE FROM OPERATE FROM THAT SPIRIT REALM DOWN TO THE PHYSICAL AND I'VE LEARNED EVEN THOUGH THE PAIN HAS BEEN SO ABSOLUTELY HORRENDOUS

ocancer10280001 I KEEP A BLOG CALLED NOT WHAT YOU HAD PLANNED DOT BLOG SPOT DOT COM AND THAT BLOG IS WILL YOU HELP PEOPLE REALIZE HOW BLESSED WE ARE I
ocancer10280002 EVEN THOUGH THEY WERE NOT BEING BLESSED AT ALL THERE ARE THINGS AROUND US OF BLESSES CONSTANTLY BUT THIS VIDEO TODAY IS NOT FOR THOSE PEOPLE THIS VIDEO IS TO HELP PEOPLE WHO HAVE BEEN
ocancer10280003 TOLD IS YOU'RE GOING TO HAVE SIGNIFICANT PIECE OF YOUR TONGUE REMOVED AND THAT DOESN'T COMING YOUR WAY QUICKLY AND I WANT TO ENCOURAGE YOU AND TO HELP
ocancer10280004 YOU REALIZE THAT IT'S SOMETHING INTO THE WORLD BUT I TELL YOU I WAS HAPPY WITH MY STORY I'M NOW TWO MONTHS POST OP I WILL SPARE YOU THE DETAILS OF MY MULTIPLE
ocancer10280005 SURGERIES BUT MY MAIN SURGERY TOOK PLACE WAS TWO MONTHS AGO TODAY IN THAT SURGERY TO REMOVE THE LEFT
ocancer10280006 HALF OF MY TONGUE LITERALLY ACTUALLY SLIGHTLY MORE THAN THE LEFT HALF AND IT TOOK THE LEFT HALF OUT BECAUSE SO MUCH WAS REMOVED IS REPLACED WITH THE SKIN
ocancer10280007 FROM MY FOREARM HE'S HAD A LARGE CHUNK OF SKIN THEY TOOK IT ALL THE WAY DOWN TO THE TENDON A NERVE AS WELL AS THE ARTERY AND VEIN
ocancer10280008 ALL THE WAY DOWN TO MY ELBOW AND THAT PIECE WAS DESIGNED TO BE A FLAP TO REBUILD MY TONGUE TO GIVE IT SOME SUBSTANCE SO MY
ocancer10280009 RIGHT HALF OF MY TONGUE THAT I WAS MOVING AROUND TISSUE MY LEFT HALF IS NOT A MUSCLE MY RIGHT HALF IS DOING DOUBLE DUTY IT LOOKS FAIRLY NORMAL
ocancer10280010 IT'S THE AVERAGE PERSON YOU MAY NOT NOTICE BUT IT'S IT'S IT'S FIXED BUT IN THAT PROCESS THEY DIDN'T GIVE THANK TO MEANING
ocancer10280011 WHO ARE FROM HERE TO HERE I QUARTER OF MY NECK THEY REMOVED IT TO THE LYMPH NODES ON THIS SIDE HE FOUND OUT THAT THE VERY TOP
ocancer10280012 A NODE WAS BURSTING FORWARD WITH CANCER FROM BECAUSE OF THAT I HAD TO GO THROUGH CHEMORADIATION AND THANKFULLY I'M TWO THIRDS AWAY THROUGH THAT THAT PROCESS
ocancer10280013 RIGHT NOW I'VE GOT ELEVEN MORE RADIATION SESSIONS TO GO AND ONE MORE CHEMO THEY'RE PRETTY LARGE DOSES OF CHEMO BUT
ocancer10280014 ANYWAY SO HAVING THAT DONE I'LL ALSO LOOK AT THE TUBE COMING OUT OF MY BELLY I'LL SAVE YOU THAT BUT THEY ARE CALLED A PEG TUBE P. E. G. A PEG
ocancer10280015 THAT ALLOWS ME BE FED WHEN I WOKE UP IN THE HOSPITAL I COULDN'T BREATHE I HAD A TRACHEOTOMY I HAD A BIG APPARATUS HERE
ocancer10280016 AND NOW ALLOWED ME TO COUGH CHOKE BREATHE WHATEVER YOUR CASE WAS AND SO BETWEEN NOW I ONLY HAVE AIR AND THEN FOOD GOING THROUGH THIS TUBE IN MY STOMACH THAT'S HOW I ATE
ocancer10280017 ATE FOR A COUPLE OF WEEKS AND EVENTUALLY AS ABLE TO START GETTING FOOD THROUGH MY THROUGH MY MOUTH OR MAYBE SOME UPDATES ON WHAT'S GOING ON WITH ME
ocancer10280018 AND WHAT TO EXPECT CHEMO PORTION OF THIS IS PRETTY HARD I'M NOT GONNA SAY IT'S EASY IT'S DIFFERENT FOR EVERYBODY THE BIG PIECE OF
ocancer10280019 I'LL GIVE YOU IS WHEN I TELL YOU TO TAKE YOUR ANTI NAUSEA MEDICATIONS STAY ON TOP OF THOSE BECAUSE KEEPING FOOD DOWN CAN BE DIFFICULT AND KEEPING YOUR FOOD DOWN YOU START LOSING WATER
ocancer10280020 AND YOU START FEELING HYDRATED YOUR WHOLE SYSTEM STARTS TO SHUT DOWN SO STAY ON TOP OF THOSE YESTERDAY I SPENT ACTUALLY THE DAY AT THE HOSPITAL WITH I. V.
ocancer10280021 HISTORY THOSE ARE GOING IN ME AGAIN BECAUSE MY SYSTEM STARTED HAVING DIFFICULTIES I AM LOSING MY VOICE RIGHT NOW BECAUSE OF RADIATION I WAS SPEAKING BETTER HERE JUST
ocancer10280022 WEEK AGO BUT THE RADIATION IS BUILDING UP AND BUILDING UP AND IT'S LIKE GETTING A BAD SUNBURN OVER AND OVER OVER THE SAME SPOT IN THAT DESTRUCTION
ocancer10280023 OF TISSUE IN THAT PROCESS HOPEFULLY IT WILL HEAL QUITE A BIT I'M A PUBLIC SPEAKER IF YOU LOOK AT MY VIDEOS YOU CAN SEE ITS LINKS PERHAPS ON MY BLOG
ocancer10280024 AS WELL AS ROBERT B. HAASE H. A. A. S. E. S. E. YOU'LL SEE SOME OTHER VIDEOS I'VE DONE FOR SOME BUSINESSES THAT I OWN BUT I'M PUBLIC SPEAKER I HAVE A RADIO
ocancer10280025 VOICE AT LEAST I HAD ONE SO I WILL ALSO GET THAT BACK BUT THE RADIATION IS DAMAGING TO A NUMBER OF STRUCTURES IS DAMAGING TO YOUR ANTERIOR NECK
ocancer10280026 YOU SEE MY TRACHEOTOMY SCAR RIGHT HERE BUT THAT THAT ANTERIOR PART STARTED TO CINCH UP AND BECOME FIBROSED AND VERY LEATHER
ocancer10280027 LIKE AND SO I TILT MY HEAD BACK YOU CAN SEE THIS I'M GOING TO ROCK MY NECK AND SO THEY GIVE ME SOME EXERCISES TO STRENGTHEN THAT
ocancer10280028 THE THERAPIST AND ME WILL TELL YOU THAT'S FINE BUT WHAT YOU DO IS STRETCH THEM OUT THAT MEANS YOU GONNA PUT SOME FAVORS ON A SHORTENED MUSCLE THEN YOUR HEAD BACK
ocancer10280029 EVERY DAY AND LENGTHEN THOSE TISSUE GET A LENGTH OUT OF THOSE YOU HAVE THE ABILITY TO MOVE THAT CONTRACTION THAT PULLING IS VERY VERY DIFFICULT IT MAKES IT HARD TO SWALLOW
ocancer10280030 EVEN YOU KNOW NORMALLY WE USE SWALLOW YOUR GIVEN ESOPHAGUS AND TRACHEA SORRY TO SHARE THE SAME THROAT AND OF TRACHEA ON TRACHEOTOMIES
ocancer10280031 BREATHING SO WHEN YOU WHEN YOU BREATHE IT GOES THROUGH THE ANTERIOR PIPE WHEN YOU SWALLOW IT COMES UP IT'S OUT OF THE WAY AND ALLOWS THIS EPIGLOTTIS PIECE
ocancer10280032 MATERIAL TO FLOP OVER AND PROTECTS IT AND THE FOOD IS DOWN YOUR YOUR ESOPHAGUS SO NOW WHEN THEY PIERCE A HOLE THROUGH YOUR THROAT THESE
ocancer10280033 MECHANISMS ARE USED TO WORK INDEPENDENTLY ARE NOW STUCK TOGETHER SO WHEN I SWALLOW NOW TO WATCH MY THROAT TAKES A MOMENT JUST A SECOND
ocancer10280034 IT LIFTS A WHOLE THROAT SO IT BECOMES VERY DIFFICULT TO EVEN SWALLOW BECAUSE IT'S MOVING SO MUCH TISSUE AND IT'S AN EXERCISE EACH TIME I SWALLOW
ocancer10280035 IT'S WORK AND SO MAKE SURE YOU KEEP THOSE STRETCHED OUT KEEP THOSE AREAS MOVING AS MUCH AS POSSIBLE DON'T OVERDO IT IF YOU MEASURE THE LYMPH NODES TAKING OUT YOUR OWN
ocancer10280036 CAUSES LYMPHOEDEMA TALK TO YOUR DOCTOR ABOUT IT BUT MAKE SURE YOU ARE STRETCHING THOSE AREAS OUT THAT RADIATION ALSO BESIDES AFFECTING THAT AFFECTS YOUR
ocancer10280037 SALIVARY GLANDS I CONSTANTLY HAVE TEA OR WATER NEARBY I JOKED ABOUT HAVING A BEER HELMET PUT ON
ocancer10280038 I GONNA HAVE THESE TUBES COMING DOWN TO DRINK CONSTANTLY BUT YOUR SALIVA A IS SO IMPORTANT IT'S IMPORTANT FOR YOUR TEETH AS ARGUMENTS ABOUT YOU KNOW
ocancer10280039 SHE'S FOR IT OR NOT BUT YOUR SALIVA IS WHAT KEEPS US HAVING STRONG TEETH AND WHEN THAT STOPS YOUR TEETH STARTS TO GET SOFTER SO YOU
ocancer10280040 DENTIST SHOULD BE MAKING YOU FLUORIDE TRAYS AND YES IT'S POISON IT'S A SMALL AMOUNT BUT LACK OF TEETH AND LACK OF NUTRITION IN YOUR BODY IS EVEN WORSE SO BE
ocancer10280041 CAREFUL AND DO SOME RESEARCH ON THAT BUT YOU PROBABLY WANT TO HAVE SOME GOOD QUALITY TRAYS MADE AND EVERY DAY YOU GUYS TAKE CARE OF YOUR TEETH BECAUSE THEY BECOME SOFTER
ocancer10280042 AND BECOME MORE BRITTLE AND YOU CAN ACTUALLY LOSE YOUR TEETH SO PARTICULARLY DENTAL HYGIENE FROM THAT THROUGH SALIVA EXPANDS WHEN A SUSPECTED PRODUCTION ESPECIALLY I'VE TALKED
ocancer10280043 PEOPLE WHO ACTUALLY HAD TOO MUCH SALIVA MADE AFTERWARDS TOWARDS MUCOSITIS IT WAS EVEN THICKER MORE LIKE GUM YOU KNOW IT'S HARD FOR THEM TO SWALLOW SO
ocancer10280044 IT AFFECTS EVERYONE SLIGHTLY DIFFERENTLY BUT IT DOES DAMAGE YOUR SALIVA AS WELL MY VOICE RIGHT NOW IS HOARSE FROM ACTUALLY
ocancer10280045 BE GROSS BUT THROWING UP YESTERDAY IT STRAINED MY THROAT QUITE A BIT BUT IT'S ALSO BEEN HOARSE ANYWAY MOSTLY FROM THE
ocancer10280046 RADIATION AND THE RADIATION DOES AFFECT THE STRUCTURES IN THERE I HAVE SORES ALL AROUND MY MOUTH ACTUALLY MY TONGUE IS MY LEAST PAINFUL
ocancer10280047 ISSUE RIGHT NOW I'VE GOT SO STITCHES IN THE VERY BACK HOLDING THESE STRUCTURES TOGETHER BUT THERE'S SORES IN THE TISSUES
ocancer10280048 THE MOUTH AND THEY HURT WHEN YOU WAKE UP IN THE NIGHT AND YOUR MOUTH IS DRY AS PAPER SALIVATE A GLASS OF WATERS TO HELP REHYDRATE THEIR MOUTH AND REHYDRATE
ocancer10280049 SORES SO PAIN MEDICATIONS I TAKE RIGHT NOW THIS PROCESS WE FOUND THE BEST WAY IS HAVE A PATCH SO I HAVE A
ocancer10280050 A PATCH TRANSDERMAL PATCH IT GIVES ME SOMETHING SLOWLY A PAIN HERE IS VERY SMALL PAIN MEDICATION BUT IT NEVER GETS BAD
ocancer10280051 AN ADDITIONAL PAIN MEDS YOU CAN TAKE IT ON TOP OF THAT BUT IT GETS PRETTY PAINFUL ESPECIALLY WHEN YOU JUST GOING TO SCORE YOUR MOUTH IMAGINE HAVING MANY SORES YOUR MOUTH SO THAT'S GOING TO BE COMING
ocancer10280052 BE PREPARED FOR THAT AND DON'T BE AFRAID OF TAKING PAYMENT SO IT'S NECESSARY FOR CERTAIN SOUNDS I SAW HER NOT MAKE VERY WELL
ocancer10280053 LIKE K'S EVER HOLD MY G'S I COULD COME AND GO EVEN A MERRY KISS THAT NOISE A PUCKERING SOMETIMES AS A LOSS OF VACUUM AND
ocancer10280054 I CAN'T EVEN MAKE THAT NOISE SO YOUR YOUR SOUNDS THROUGH INFLAMMATION OR COME AND GO INFLAMMATION YOUR THROAT INFLAMMATION YOUR TONGUE ALL THOSE PIECES
ocancer10280055 WERE COMING TO GO AND SO WHEN YOU THINK YOU'VE GOT A CERTAIN AMOUNT OF RECOVERY IT MAY OR MAY NOT BE THERE BECAUSE IT WILL COME AND GO
ocancer10280056 I SHOULD BE DONE ABOUT TWO MORE WEEKS OF THERAPY AND I'M TOLD IT'S GONNA BE ABOUT A MONTH BEFORE ALL THE SORES
ocancer10280057 ARE CHILL AND I START DIVING BACK TOWN THE BIGGEST THING FOR ME HAS BEEN FOOD I BESIDES THE WAY CHEMO MAKES THINGS TASTE LIKE
ocancer10280058 PAPER OR MY FRIEND TASTES CARDBOARD WHEN SHE HAD HERS CHEMO TAKES AWAY FROM YOUR FLAVOR WELL IMAGINE EATING
ocancer10280059 PASTE WITHOUT THE MINTY SMELL I MEAN LITERALLY YOU HAVE FOOD WITH NO FLAVOR IN THE BRAIN OFTEN WOULD GAG BASED ON THAT
ocancer10280060 YOU HAVE FLAVORS TEXTURES AND THOSE KINDS OF THINGS SO IT'S GONNA BE HARD TO EAT THE RADIATION IS SEVERELY SEVERELY
ocancer10280061 REDUCED ALL FLAVOR IN MY MOUTH AND I USED TO BE THE FIRST THING YOU LOSE IS SWEET SO THEY ARE GAIN WEIGHT BY USING ICE CREAM OR KEEP MY WEIGHT ON AND THE DOCTORS WANT YOU
ocancer10280062 TO THEY WANT YOU TO KEEP YOUR WEIGHT ON BECAUSE YOU CAN'T FIGHT CANCER IF YOU'RE LOSING WEIGHT FAST MY BODY IS ACTUALLY DROPPING TO THE FORTY POUNDS THAT'S FOUR
ocancer10280063 ZERO POUNDS SINCE THIS WHOLE ORDEAL STARTED AND IT'S HARD TO FIGHT WHEN YOUR SYSTEMS ARE LOSING THE VERY SUBSTANCE OF LIFE SO
ocancer10280064 I'VE LOST NOW TASTE AND FIRST THING TO GO WITH SWEETS AND LASTLY LOSE THE SALT I WAS PUTTING SALT ON EVERYTHING I PUT SALT ON NOTHING OUT BECAUSE THE SALT
ocancer10280065 BURNS THE SORES IN MY MOUTH SO NOW I USE THE PEG TUBE AND A PEG TUBE I'LL MAKE SURE OVERLAY THE VIDEO OVER THE PEG TUBE LOOKS LIKE
ocancer10280066 DURING THIS VIDEO YOU'RE WATCHING BUT A PEG TOOL IS WHAT WE PUT SYRINGES INTO THAT ALLOWS ME TO SQUEEZE FOOD IN SLOWLY YOU CAN LITERALLY EAT AN ENTIRE MEAL
ocancer10280067 A MATTER OF JUST MOMENTS I MEAN YOU DO THAT OVERWHELMS THE BRAIN DOESN'T WANT TO STAY IN SO MAKE SURE YOU TAKE YOUR TIME WHEN YOU GET THOSE KIND OF FEELINGS I WILL TELL YOU
ocancer10280068 THAT THE HOSPITAL ARE GOING TO TRY TO SELL YOU ON THESE PRE MADE FORMULAS MADE BY VARIOUS COMPANIES I WON'T SLANDER ANY COMPANIES OUT THERE BUT THEY
ocancer10280069 BASICALLY ADULT FORMULAS OF BALANCED NUTRITION I CARE MORE ABOUT MY BODY THAN MOST I WOULD SUPPOSE AND THOSE FORMULAS ARE NOT OKAY FOR ME
ocancer10280070 SO YOU'RE USING A COMBINATION OF REAL FOOD I GET HIGH QUALITY SUPPLEMENT POWDERS HIGH QUALITY AND NEURO REPLACEMENT POWDER I DON'T HAVE
ocancer10280071 ALL THE GARBAGE DON'T USE SUGAR I'M USING HIGH QUALITY STUFF YOU ALSO JUST OPEN UP A CAN OR YOU KNOW SOME KIND OF A
ocancer10280072 SOUP AND PUT THROUGH A VITAMIX OR SOMETHING THAT SORTS OF LIQUIFIES YOUR FOOD WHATEVER YOUR FAMILY'S HAVING THAT DAY WILL TOSS SOME WATER AND TOSS THAT MEAL
ocancer10280073 INTO A VITAMIX PUREE IT UNTIL IT'S TOTALLY LIQUEFIED AND YOU CAN USE THAT TO EAT BUT IF YOU EAT JUST FORMULAS OFTEN PEOPLE GET HEARTBURN
ocancer10280074 IT'S NOT BALANCED NUTRITION OVER TIME YOU WANT TO MIX UP YOUR SYSTEM SO MAKE SURE YOU GOOD NUTRITION AND INVEST IN SOMETHING THAT ALLOWS YOU TO PUREE YOUR FOOD AND LIQUIFY IT
ocancer10280075 I KNOW VITAMIX FOR EXAMPLE ACTUALLY WILL HEAT YOUR SOUP BY THE HIGH SPEED OF THE BLADES SO I'M NOT INVESTING IN VITAMIX I'M GETTING MONEY FROM THEM BUT
ocancer10280076 INVEST IN SOMETHING SUPERIOR IN QUALITY I'VE TOLD THE NINJA IS PRETTY GOOD BUT MAKE SURE IT LIQUEFIES SO SMALL IN FITTING IS THE SMALL DIAMETER OF THE TUBE THAT THEY GIVE YOU
ocancer10280077 YOU SO AGAIN I HOPE THIS HAS HELPFUL FOR YOU THIS IS JUST SOME INSIGHTS INTO WHAT'S GOING TO COME YOU KNOW IT'S NOW
ocancer10280078 THE FIRST WEEK OF DECEMBER TWO THOUSAND THIRTEEN AND I'M TOLD THAT BY MAY OR JUNE I MIGHT GET MOST OF MY FLAVOR BACK ON THE ONE HALF OF MY TONGUE
ocancer10280079 SO EVERYTHING'S CHANGED FLAVOR EVERYTHING THAT USED TO TASTE NORMAL IS DIFFERENT AND I'M LOOKING FORWARD TO HAVING THAT BACK BUT YOU CAN DO THIS
ocancer10280080 DRINK LOTS OF WATER TAKE CARE OF YOUR BODY STRETCH BREATHE I KNOW THAT IT'S NOT THE END OF THE ROAD YOU GET THROUGH THIS SO HAVE ANY QUESTIONS
ocancer10280081 GO TO MY BLOG AND AGAIN NOT WHAT YOU HAD PLANNED DOT BLOG SPOT DOT COM THERE'S AN EMAIL ADDRESS LINK ON THERE FEEL FREE TO EMAIL ME IF YOU NEED TO IF I HAVE A CHANCE
ocancer10280082 TO ANSWER YOUR QUESTIONS AS I GO THROUGH THIS PROCESS I WISH YOU WELL I'M EXCITED FOR YOUR FUTURE YOU HAVE ONE
ocancer10300001 AND LUCKILY I WAS DIAGNOSED AND I WAS STARTED TREATMENT ALMOST IMMEDIATELY THE CHEMOTHERAPY WAS PRETTY GOOD
ocancer10300002 THEY'VE COME A LONG WAY NOW SO PEOPLE WORRIED ABOUT IT THEY SHOULDN'T I MEAN THEY HAVE DRUGS NOW YOU DON'T EVEN GET NAUSEAOUS THE TUMOURS ARE COMPLETELY GONE THE DOCTORS CAN'T FIND THEM SO I'M HAPPY
ocancer10330001 FROM CHICAGO ILLINIOS RETIRED FIRE FIGHTER AFTER THIRTY YEARS I KNOW THAT SOMETHING
ocancer10330002 BOTHERING ME UNDERNEATH THE TONGUE I WAS GETTING PRETTY GROUCHY WITH EVERYONE EVERYTIME THAT LITTLE GROWTH WOULD HIT MY TEETH I COULDN'T TAKE ALLERGIES I WAS ALWAYS IN A BAD MOOD
ocancer10330003 THE PAIN THAT I HAD WAS UNBEARABLE SO WHEN YOU SAY CANCER HURTS IT HURTS THEY TOLD ME I HAD
ocancer10330004 A SQUAMOUS CELL CARCINOMA I BELIEVE IT'S CALLED IF I HAD TO TAKE CARE OF IT THERE IS A FIFTY SOMETHING PERCENT THAT
ocancer10330005 I WOULD DIE BUT IF I TAKE CARE OF IT THEN IT GOES UP INTO YOUR HIGH NINETIES THAT'S A NOBRAINER
ocancer10330006 I HAD THE CHOICE TO GO TO A DIFFERENT HOSPITAL BUT SOMETHING JUST DIDN'T FEEL RIGHT BUT THEN DR MARCO WHEN HE STARTED TALKING TO ME AND HE
ocancer10330007 HE MADE ME SO COMFORTABLE SO YEAH HE HE GOT ME REALLY CALM AND I WAS READY FOR ALL THIS I STILL DON'T BELIEVE HOW THEY JUST
ocancer10330008 THEY JUST CARED IT WITH EVERY EVERY SEEM LIKED ALMOST EVERY HOUR AND THE HOUR JUST CHECKING UP ON ME WHICH I THOUGHT THAT WAS NICE
ocancer10330009 I MEAN I DON'T SEE THAT YOU DON'T SEE THAT AT LEAST I DON'T SEE THAT EVERYWHERE BUT I SAW IT HERE NOW I STOP AND LISTEN TO PEOPLE THAT HAVE
ocancer10330010 ACTUALLY GONE THROUGH STUFF I FEEL MORE AT HEART WHEN PEOPLE TELL ME YEAH I WENT THROUGH THAT OR MY MOTHER WENT THROUGH THAT IT'S LIKE WOW YOU GUYS REALLY WENT THROUGH A LOT
ocancer10330011 OF PAIN OR A LOT OF SOMETHING TOTALLY DIFFERENT THAT JUST GONNA CHANGE YOUR LIFE
