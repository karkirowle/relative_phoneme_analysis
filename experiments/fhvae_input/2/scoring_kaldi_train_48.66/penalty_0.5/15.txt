ocancer10210057 AFTER TWO WEEKS  CHECKED OUT AND ALLOW THE DENTIST DON'T EVEN KNOW WE WON'T KNOW WHAT IT IS A SAFE TO SOAR  HAVEN'T 
ocancer10210058 I DON'T SEE IF IT'S BEEN MORE THAN TWO WEEKS BECAUSE A LOT OF TIMES  KANSAS ITS  MINE WAS ABOUT HIM 
ocancer10210059 LIKE THIS IN THE BASEMENT ON ABOUT ONE HALF CENT  ARE OWNED BY ABOUT ONE HUNDRED METER HIGH AND I'M NOT SURE HOW DEEP  BUT 
ocancer10210060 AND THEY THINK THAT THE EARLY STAGES TO THE WARNINGS KNOWN BUT WHEN THEY FIND IT WON A CAKE ALTHOUGH NOT BECAUSE THEY WANT 
ocancer10210061 AND THEN  ALL THAT THE HIGHEST LEVEL I. S. OF RADIATION THAT WOULD KILL ANYTHING ELSE 
ocancer10210062 IT'S POSSIBLE IN THEM BUT NOW  ALTERNATIVE METHODS AND PREVENT IT FROM RETURNING I. YEAH

ocancer10220014 I. B. M. FACES THAT I REALIZED I MIGHT YESTERDAY  THAT SOUNDS SILLY BUT ANOTHER HUGE THING FOR ME REALIZE A MORE 
ocancer10220015 AND AS THE POSSIBILITY THAT COULD HAPPEN SO I BEING ABLE TO A SHARE FOR FAMILY FRIENDS AS SEVERE AS  SO

ocancer10220021  AND OUR FOCUS IS A HUGE  PIECE OF  POWER IN SUCCEEDING THAT IT'S EASY TO THE LOSS AND HARDSHIP WE HAVE 
ocancer10220022 IT'S EASY TO FOCUS ON THAT HAVE A DISCOUNT AND TRACK OUR ENTIRE ATTENTION AND FOCUS ON WE DON'T HAVE ARE FOCUSING SO MUCH WAS LOST WE DON'T HAVE TO FORGET WHAT WE DO HAVE 
ocancer10220023  CURRENT LAW'S A CHILD  THE FACT THAT OUT TO OTHERS DON'T SPEND TIME WITH BECAUSE A SO SO FOCUSED ON WHAT THEY DON'T HAVE ANY MORE IN THAT SOUGHT

ocancer10220028  BE GONE SO THE BUSES TO THEIR DRESSES THEATER PEOPLE WHO HAVE  OUT WAR 
ocancer10220029 ABOUT TO HAVE ONE OR MAYBE FRIENDS AND FAMILY WHO ARE DOING RESEARCH IN TRYING TO SUPPORT SOMEBODY WHO'S GONE THROUGH ONE IS ABOUT TO GO THROUGH ONE  RACES 
ocancer10220030 BASED ON THINGS I'VE BEEN THROUGH LAST FIVE YEARS IF YOU SOMETHING YOU MIGHT NOT EXPECT THE THINGS I WAS TOLD THAT MIGHT HAPPEN SO WHAT 
ocancer10220031 FOR TIGHTER THAN THEY USED AGAIN GARZA  SIDE EFFECTS OF ALL THIS STUFF IS BAD NUMBER ONE THING IS ALIVE SOME ALIVE EVEN COMPLAINED 
ocancer10220032 AND PEOPLE THINK I HAVE ALWAYS PROBLEMS BUT CAN'T GO I FEEL SO THE DOWNSIDE TREATMENT SHOULD LIVE HAS A WHOLE POINT OF  OF LIFE OPPORTUNITY 
ocancer10220033 SO SIDE EFFECTS LIES ON THEIR AREA RESTS ON ONE'S THAT HAD ACTUALLY COMPANY NEARLY OF ALMOST TWO DOZEN BUT THE BIGGER ONES THAT HAVE  
ocancer10220034 ACTIVE FIRST WAS  OR MEET SIGN M. I. FOR WATER SOME  TREATMENT AND PREVENTION MUCH AS A BE A SUDDEN SURGE 
ocancer10220035 THE PAINFUL SURGE FROM A LOWER BODY I.  HAS BECOME WEEK ALL AT ONCE AN OUNCE ON SOMETHING THAT CAME SPECIFICALLY BECAUSE I HAVE A FEW OF THEIR VEHICLES 
ocancer10220036 SPOTTING WITH SEVERAL RADIATION THAT COMBINATION ON SOME PEOPLE DOES CAUSE OR RESIGNED AND  THE WORD THAT I.'S IT'S NOT  
ocancer10220037 TELL ME IT'S JUST A NOT FUN ESPECIALLY  FOR SOMETHING THAT MENTIONED I HAPPEN TO ME AND MY TEACHERS WERE WEAKENED BY CHEMOTHERAPY 
ocancer10220038 WE  TISSUES FOUR YEARS AND YEARS TO COME AND  AIR CONDITIONER THIS LAST SUMMER AS  
ocancer10220039 AN AIR CONDITIONER WAS ASKING FOR HELP IT SHOULD HAVE A HEAVY AMOUNT I BOUGHT FROM A LOCAL STORE AND I WAS  AMOUNT BROKE AND  
ocancer10220040 THE AIR CONDITIONERS ONE HAND AND  MODELS AND  SHOULDER AND  SURGERY FOR THAT I'M EFFECT ON THE LAST  EMBRACE AND SAY MUCH ABOUT IT 
ocancer10220041 BUT SEARS IS A WEAK AND  AND A BIG EFFECT ON ME I HAVE  ANALYSTS SAY MY FACE OF  
ocancer10220042 VERY LONG AS ALL THE  FACE AND ACTING GOALS  PLAYING IT BECOMES  AND HER START  FOR A MUCH SO  
ocancer10220043 DO UNLIKELY THAT A SECOND BET MY THE BIGGEST SINGLE LATELY HAS HAPPENED THE LAST SIX MONTHS IS A CONDITION CALLED  
ocancer10220044 THE ORE  AND SAY MY PEOPLE ASSUME ALL WHO ACTUALLY HAVE THE MUSCLES  HAS AN ANGLE I WANT TO DO THAT BY FIAT 
ocancer10220045 AND SO MY MUSCLES ARE COSTLY AND BATTLE  BACK AND FORTH  STREET BUT THIS THOUSAND CONSTANTLY  TOP OF A HARD 
ocancer10220046 THE BACKUP TRY TO TREAT  ROUNDS OF OF HAVING THE TALKS DONE MY NECK AND TO RAISE EXPENSIVE PROCESS 
ocancer10220047 AND IT WEAKENS MUSCLE AND IS A LOT OF FUNCTIONS WILL SUFFER ME THAT MAKES ME NERVOUS I HAVE A WEEK MOST OF MY NEXT  APARTMENTS ALSO 
ocancer10220048 A WAY THAT TO THE REPORT IS IS A NEW CAN'T HAVE THIS  PARKINSON SEE MY NECK SOMETIMES BECAUSE I GET THESE  
ocancer10220049 MOTIONS WITH THE ARITHMETIC OF FARMER I. AND I CAN'T SAY I CAN'T HELP  THE MUSCLE AND THAT THE  PIECES VERY ODD 
ocancer10220050 I BEGAN SIDE EFFECT OF ALL THE TREATMENT OF  ISSUES ALL THAT MOVEMENT IS AFFECTING THE  AS WELL AS MORE PROBLEMS BUT 
ocancer10220051 IDEAS SO YOU HAVE SIDE EFFECTS FROM THAT THE YEN ON THE LIFE  THE YEAR TO TALK TO YOU AND ENCOURAGE PEOPLE SO IT'S A GOOD  NOT  
ocancer10220052 I. S. MARKETS LIKE  COMPLAIN BUT NOW IT'S NOT WORTH THE  TALK ABOUT DEPOSIT THINGS THAT ARE ALL MY LIFE 
ocancer10220053 AND THOSE WHO HAVE RADIATION IS PART OF YOUR TREATMENT TO  YOU HAVE RADIATION I HAVE SOME EXTRA IDEAS FOR USING  ARE IMPORTANT I'VE LEARNED 
ocancer10220054 THE  HAD THIS TO HAVE NOT HAD THE ORAL CARE AND LOS  RUNNING ARE FALLING APART SO THE 
ocancer10220055  HAD SOME EARLY ON A FRIEND  WILL GIVE ME SOMETHING CALLED A  FURNISH AND  A REGULAR BASIS OF SOMETHING 
ocancer10220056  YOUR  PERHAPS BUT THAT FORD TAURUS DOES IS ALLOW YOU TO EYE ACTUALLY HAVE IT CAN SLOWS 
ocancer10220057  SEES IT HELPS TO STRENGTHEN KNOWS IT ALSO HELPS TO AVOID U. K.  AS WELL SO YOU HAVE  FLOORS OF TOYS IN THE SAME TIME AS 
ocancer10220058 USED PROPERLY CONNECTION  QUITE A BIT I HAVE MY TEETH THAN FOUR TIMES A YEAR AND IT'S ABOUT TWICE AS OFTEN AS RECOMMENDED THAT WHEN YOU HAVE A LOCK US ALIVE A 
ocancer10220059  ACTION IN AMOUNTS OF ALL IT ACTUALLY BAD FOR YOUR TEETH AND THAT  OF HANDLING FOUR TIMES  PROPERLY 
ocancer10220060 AFTER EVERY TIME I EAT ANY FOOD ALWAYS A WATER PICK OUR OTHER TYPE OF  LIKE THE THREE OF THEM ACTUALLY ONE FOR TRAVEL

ocancer10220062  CAN'T AFFORD CATEGORIES  YOU HAVE A  CAN'T CLEAN  SO IT'S WORTHWHILE HAVE A  MARKET THE 
ocancer10220063 ANOTHER THING TO THINK ABOUT IS TALKING TO A  START TALKING TO A SUMMARY OF THE HEALTH  QUALITY ATTRITION TO BE WILL 
ocancer10220064 HER BODY THE ABILITY TO HAVE  THE LAST SUCH A BUILT IN AND  IN SUPPORT OF BONE FUNCTION IN BONE GROWTH SO YOU WANT TO LOOK AT HAVING 
ocancer10220065 HIGH QUALITY   IS WELL UNDER SYSTEM YOU HAVE SOMETHING IN A MUSEUM YOU HAVE OF VITAMINS A. A. C. AND D. O. 
ocancer10220066 THE HELP OF BONDS AS WELL AS C. JUST GET FROM THE STANDPOINT OF THE TWO SEASONS OUT BUT THE BIGGER ONE TO  WORKING THE START
