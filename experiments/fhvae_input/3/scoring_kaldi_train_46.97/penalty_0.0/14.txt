ocancer10210057 AFTER  CHECKED OUT IN A LOT OF DENTISTS DON'T EVEN KNOW WE WON'T KNOW WHAT IT IS  TO SOAR    
ocancer10210058 I DON'T SEE IF IT'S BEEN MORE THAN TWO WEEKS BECAUSE A LOT OF TIMES THE FINDING ITS KANSAS ITS  MINE WAS ABOUT  
ocancer10210059 LIKE THIS IN THE BASEMENT ON ABOUT ONE HALF CENT  YOUNG BY ABOUT ONE SOME  ARE HIGH AND I'M NOT SURE HOW DEEP IT WIN BUT 
ocancer10210060 AND THEY THINK THAT THE EARLY SPREAD TO THE WARNINGS MAN BUT WHEN THEY FIND IT WARNED THEY TAKE ALL OF THEM OUT BECAUSE THE

ocancer10220007  BY CHEMOTHERAPY AND RADIATION THERAPIES IT  ME SOMETHING I WOULD CALL BONUS TIME YOU KNOW THAT THOSE THERAPIES ARE HORRENDOUS BE YET THEY GIVE YOU ACTUALLY 
ocancer10220008 THE OPPORTUNITY OF LIFE AND THE B. I. BEEN ABLE TO HAVE A CHANCE TO SPEND TIME IN BUS PEOPLE ENCOURAGE THEM IN THE  NOT JUST CANCER BUT 
ocancer10220009 I  LOST THEIR JOBS LOST THEIR MARRIAGES A LOSS TO THE BUSINESS OR THEIR HOME OR YOU KNOW  WORST LOSS OF CHILD 
ocancer10220010 HOWEVER SHE BROUGHT DOWN TO ONE COMMON WERE NET LOSS I  MY TONGUE A LOSS LAST OFF BUT I  MY UNIVERSE IS NOT LOST 
ocancer10220011 YOU KNOW YOU KNOW I LOST MY  MY BUSINESS MY  MY HOUSE MY CAR I  MY WIFE LEFT OUR MARRIAGE 
ocancer10220012 AND A CANCER ON A VERY SHORT PERIOD OF TIME AND IT SOUNDS HORRIBLE TO GET THE SAME TIME AS IT IS EASY TO FOCUS ON WHAT WE DON'T HAVE ENOUGH FOCUS ON THE BEACH 
ocancer10220013 HALF AND THAT DEBT TO STEAL FROM YEARS MY AND INSTABILITY HERE WE THINK WE'RE ALL IN MORAL RIGHT HAND I DON'T THINK ABOUT DEATH ROW WHILE THINK ABOUT DEATH  
ocancer10220014 I  FACED WITH THAT I REALIZED I MIGHT YESTERDAY YOU KNOW THAT SOUNDS SILLY BUT ANOTHER HUGE THING FOR ME REALIZE A MORE 
ocancer10220015 AND AS THE POSSIBILITY THAT COULD HAPPEN SO I BUT BEING ABLE TO A SHARE FOR FAMILY FRIENDS AS SEVERE AS  SCENES OF  
ocancer10220016 TWO YEARS IT HAS SO FAR IT HAS LOST FIVE TO HIS OTHER EXPRESSIONS I FIRST  BEFORE THAT IT'S NOT SO MUCH LIFE IS  
ocancer10220017 BUT IT'S ON DESTINATION UNIVERSAL LIFE IS NOT ABOUT EATING SOMEWHERE ARTICLES WE HAVE TO GET SOME WORRIES ABOUT THAT PROCESS ON THE WAY IN TWO THOUSAND FIFTEEN 
ocancer10220018 I HAD LOST MUCH ASSISTANCE SHERRY  BEFORE AND AFTER NINE YEARS TOTALING ABOUT POINT TO AN AMAZING WOMAN

ocancer10220020 A HUGE LOSS THE YEAR BUT THE SAME TIME THEY ARE RIGHT AND THAT THE WOMAN MERGER ANNOUNCEMENT KAREN AND SHIITE  IS SO  A  
ocancer10220021 AND OUR FOCUS IS A HUGE  PIECE OF  POWER IS EXCEEDING THAT IT'S EASY TO THE LOSS AND  
ocancer10220022 IT'S EASY TO FOCUS ON THAT HAVE A DISCOUNT AND TRAP OUR ENTIRE ATTENTION AND FOCUS ON WE DON'T HAVE ARE FOCUSING SO MUCH FOR LOSSES DON'T HAVE TO FORGET WHAT WE DO HAVE 
ocancer10220023  CURRENT LOSS OF CHILD CARE FOR GAINED EFFECTIVE OUT TO OTHERS THAT ARE NOT SPEND TIME WITH BECAUSE A SO SO FOCUSED ON WHAT THEY DON'T HAVE ANY MORE IN THAT SOUGHT  
ocancer10220024  TO FOCUS ON WHAT YOU HAVE FOCUSED ON A BUS IS A LIFE OF  THEIR WAY ALONG THAT PROCESS  YOU NOW HAVE A WIFE OF US MAJOR EARLY AND GOT 
ocancer10220025 THREE DOLLARS TO I LOVE INCREDIBLY A VERY PROUD OF THEM I HAVE PARENTS IN THE EIGHTIES ARE THRIVING IN DOING WELL I'M BACK TO TEACHING SEMINARS

ocancer10220027 PER HOUR FOR THE QUARTER WHILE THAT WAS THAT I DREAMED OF MIND AND I HAD NO IDEA TO THE MEETINGS WHERE COME AFTER HAVING CHEMOTHERAPY 
ocancer10220028 RADIATION THINK YOU HAVE TO BE GONE SO THE BOSS'S OF THEIR DRESSES VIDEOS ARE PEOPLE WHO HAVE HAD A  OR 
ocancer10220029 ABOUT TO HAVE ONE OR MAYBE FRIENDS AND FAMILY WHO ARE DOING RESEARCH IN TRYING TO SUPPORT SOMEBODY WHO'S GONE THROUGH ONE IS ABOUT TO GO THROUGH ONE SO NEWS AND INFORMATION SERVICES 
ocancer10220030 BASED ON THINGS I'VE BEEN THROUGH LAST FIVE YEARS I  YOU MIGHT NOT EXPECT THE THINGS I WAS TOLD THAT MIGHT HAPPEN SO   
ocancer10220031 FOR TIGHTER THAN IS AGAIN I  SIDE EFFECTS OF ALL THIS STUFF IS BAD NUMBER ONE THINGS IN LIFE IS TO COME ALIVE EVEN COMPLAINED 
ocancer10220032 PEOPLE THINK I HAVE ALWAYS PROBLEMS BUT CAN'T GO I FEEL SO THE DOWNSIDE OF TREATMENT IF YOU LIVE AS A WHOLE POINT OF  AND THAT'S LIFE OPPORTUNITY 
ocancer10220033 SO SIDE EFFECTS LIES ON THE ARRESTS ARE ONES THAT HAD ACTUALLY COMPANY NEARLY ON ITS TWO DOZEN BUT THEY ARE ONES THAT HAVE  
ocancer10220034 AXA FIRST WAS THE SHARPEST CALL OR MEET SIGN IN MY  FOR SOME EVEN DURING TREATMENT AND PREVENTION MUCH AS A  A SUDDEN SURGE 
ocancer10220035 THE PAINFUL SURGE MULLER BODY I.  HAS BECOME A WEEK ALL AT ONCE AN OUNCE ON SOMETHING THAT CAN SPECIFICALLY BECAUSE I HAVE A FEW OTHER VEHICLES 
ocancer10220036 SPOTTING A SOCIAL RADIATION A COMBINATION OF SOME PEOPLE DOES CAUSE OR RESIGN AND THUS OF THE WORLD THAT IT'S IT'S NOT  
ocancer10220037  IS JUST A AND NOT FUN ESPECIALLY  FOR SOMETHING THAT MUCH IN DOUBT THAT I HAPPEN TO ME I  ISSUES WERE WEAKENED BY CHEMOTHERAPY 
ocancer10220038 WE  TISSUES FOUR YEARS IN YEARS TO COME AND  AIR CONDITIONER THIS LAST OF SUMMER I WAS  
ocancer10220039 UNDER COMMISSIONER WAS ASKING FOR HELP IT SHOULD HAVE A HEAVY AMOUNT I BOUGHT FROM A LOCAL A HOME STORE AND AUGUST INSTALLING AN OUTLOOK AND  
ocancer10220040 THE AIR CONDITIONERS ONE HAND AND  MUSCLES AND I OFFER MY SHOULDER AND HAD SURGERY FOR THAT I MIGHT ACT ON THE LAST DAY AS  RACE AND SAY MUCH ABOUT IT 
ocancer10220041 BUT SEARS ISSUES ARE WEAK AND CURRENTLY AND HAVE THE EFFECT ON ME I  ANALYSTS CITE MY FACE OF  
ocancer10220042 VERY LONG AS ALL THE ENTIRE SAID MY FACE AN ACTING   PLAYING IT BECOMES AN EYE AND HER SIDE GONE FROM THE OFFER MUCH SO I STILL 
ocancer10220043 TO DO AN  THAT A SECOND BUT ONE OF THESE THINGS LATEST HAPPENED PROBABLY THE LAST SIX MONTHS IS A CONDITION CALLED SOCIALIST  
ocancer10220044 I  OR  AND SAY MY SEAT OR SO WHILE WHO ACTUALLY HAVE THE MUSCLES TIGHTEN IT HAS AN AMPLE I WANT TO DO THAT BY FIAT 
ocancer10220045 AND SO MY MUSCLES ARE COSTLY AND BATTLE THE TIGERS ARE FIGHTING BACK AND FORTH IN THE NEXT RATE BUT THE  CONSTANTLY  THE TOP OF A HARD 
ocancer10220046 THE BACK OF TRIED THREE ROUNDS OF OF HAVING NO TALKS DONE MY NECK AND TO RAISE EXPENSIVE PROCESS 
ocancer10220047 AND IT WEAKENS MUSCLE AND IS A LOT OF FUNCTIONS WILL SUFFER ME THAT MAKES ME NERVOUS I HAVE A WEEK MOST OF MY NEXT  CAN SUPPORT MYSELF SO I 
ocancer10220048 A WAY THAT'S THE  PART IS IS A NEW CAN'T HAVE THE SPACE  PARKINSON IS IN MY NECK SOMETIMES BECAUSE I GET THESE  OF BOB  
ocancer10220049 MOTIONS WITH THE RULES MAKE A FARMER AND I CAN'T SAY I CAN'T HELP  THE MUSCLE IN ON THAT THAT THE  PIECES VERY ON 
ocancer10220050 I BEGAN A SIDE EFFECT OF ALL THE TREATMENT OF YEARS AGO TO START ISSUES ALL THAT MOVEMENT IS AFFECTING THE  AS WELL I WAS MORE PROBLEMS BUT  
ocancer10220051 IDEAS SO YOU HAVE SIDE EFFECTS FROM THAT THE YEN ON THE LIFE  TO TALK TO ENCOURAGE PEOPLE SO AS TO THE GLASS THEY SAY YOU KNOW HOW YOU DO 
ocancer10220052 I. S. MARKETS LIKE  COMPLAIN BUT NOW IT'S NOT WORTH THE  TALK ABOUT THE POSITIVE THINGS THAT ARE AROUND MY LIFE 
ocancer10220053 AND FOR THOSE WHO HAD RADIATION IS PART OF YOUR TREATMENT TO  YOU HAVE RADIATION I HAVE SOME EXTRA IDEAS FOR USING  ARE IMPORTANT I'VE LEARNED 
ocancer10220054 THE  HAD THIS TO HAVE NOT HAD AN ORAL CARE AND LOS  WHICH IS RUNNING ARE FALLING APART SO A 
ocancer10220055 HIS LOSS TO HAVE SOME EARLY ON A FRIEND OF THE  WILL GIVE ME SOMETHING CALLED A  FURNISH AND  THE BASIS OF SOMETHING 
ocancer10220056 IT TENDS TO DO WITH THE HIGH SIERRA  PERHAPS I THOUGHT THAT FOR  DOES IS ALLOW YOU TO ACTUALLY HAVE IT CAN SLOWS 
ocancer10220057  THAT HELPS TO STRENGTHEN THOSE IT ALSO HELPS TO AVOID U. K. EQUITIES AS WELL SO YOU HAVE THE FLOOR AS A POISON THE SAME TIME AS 
ocancer10220058 USED PROPERLY  TO HELP IT QUITE A BIT I HAVE MY TEETH THAN FOUR TIMES A YEAR AND IT'S ABOUT TWICE AS OFTEN AS RECOMMENDED BUT WHEN YOU HAVE A LOCK US ALIVE 
ocancer10220059 IT'S LIKE A FRACTION OF A MOUSE ALL IT IS ACTUALLY BAD FOR YOUR TEETH AND THAT  SO I DON'T THINK FOUR TIMES  ARE PROPERLY 
ocancer10220060 AFTER EVERY TIME I EAT A FOOD ALWAYS WATER PICK ANOTHER OTHER TYPE OF A PRODUCT LIKE THE  THROUGH THEM ACTUALLY ONE FOR TRAVEL 
ocancer10220061 ONE INDICATION WHEN MY  EVERYWHERE I  A MOUSE OUT TO  THREE FOUR TIMES A DAY OF TO KEEP THAT STUFF 
ocancer10220062 MY T. SO IT CAN'T AFFORD CARRIES  TO HOW MUCH TIME THANK YOU CAN'T CLEAN  SO IT'S WORTHWHILE HABITS IN YOUR POCKET A 
ocancer10220063 NOTHING TO THINK ABOUT IS TALKING TO A  START TALKING TO SOME BE A HEALTHY START GOING TO QUALITY AND NUTRITION TO BE ABLE TO  
ocancer10220064 HER BODY AND ABILITY TO HAVE ASKED AGO AND GLASS OF SUCH TO THOSE IN AND YOU'RE IN SUPPORT TO BOND AUCTION  BONE GROWTH SO YOU WANT TO LOOK AT HAVING

ocancer10280051  ON TOP OF THAT BUT BECAUSE THREE PEOPLE ESPECIALLY  FOR YOUR MOUTH MATCH HAVING ANY SOURCE FOR MOUTH THAT'S IN BECOMING 
ocancer10280052 BE PREPARED FOR THAT AND DON'T BE AFRAID OF TAKING PAYMENTS IS NECESSARY TO A CERTAIN SOUNDS  THAT MAKE VERY WELL

ocancer10280059 PACED THE  OF FOOD IS NO FLAVOR IN THE BRAIN AND OFTEN I. BASED ON THAT 
ocancer10280060 YOU HAVE FLAVORED STRUCTURES THOSE KINDS OF THINGS SO IT'S REALLY HARD TO EAT THE RADIATION IS SEVERELY SEVERELY 
ocancer10280061 REDUCED ALL FLAVOR MY MOUTH AND USED TO BE THE FIRST THING YOU LOSE A SWEET SO THEY ARE  BY USING ICE CREAM AND KEEP IT AWAY ON AND DOCTORS WANT 
ocancer10280062 IT'S GOING TO KEEP YOUR WAY ON BECAUSE YOU CAN'T FIGHT CANCER IF YOU'RE LOSING WEIGHT FACTS I WAS ACTUALLY DROPPED TO FORTY POUNDS FOR 
ocancer10280063 ZERO POUND SINCE THIS WHOLE DEAL STARTED AND IT'S HARD TO FIND YOUR SYSTEMS ARE LOSING THEIR VERY SUBSTANTIVE LIFE SO I

ocancer10280072 TO IMPROVE THROUGH A  FOR FOOD WITH THEIR FAMILIES HAVING A DAY WILL TOSS HIM WATER  
ocancer10280073 SOME OF MY  PURE IT IS ALSO A LIQUEFIED  THAT TO EAT BUT IF YOU EAT THOSE FORMULAS  HARBOR

ocancer10280080  OF WATER TAKE YOUR BODY STRETCH BREED I KNOW THAT'S NOT THE ROAD BUT ITS SERVICE SO MANY QUESTIONS 
ocancer10280081 IN MY  NOT  PLAN DON'T LIKE SPOTS ICAHN  DRESS THINK ON THEIR  TOO IF I HAD CANCELED 
ocancer10280082 THE ANSWER QUESTIONS I GO THROUGH THIS PROCESS I WISH HIM WELL I  HER 
ocancer10340001 I WAS DIAGNOSED WITH 
ocancer10340002   TONGUE AND BACK IN MARCH THAT THE SIXTEEN OF THE TWO YEARS AGO AT THE AGE OF TWENTY SIX I THINK I NOTICED 
ocancer10340003 A SMALL DUMP ON MY TONGUE ONE MORNING AND EARLY IN JANUARY AFTER THE NEW YEAR AND IT'S LIKE THAT'S VERY STRANGE FOR  A LARGE SIDE 
ocancer10340004  AWAY AND DIDN'T THEN BY I  LATE JANUARY AND IN THE MONTH WHEN C. I  
ocancer10340005 I. T. AND T.'S BOTH ME AND SAID NO LESS VERY STRANGE I. AND I ASKED TO TEST A SWAP OF IT 
ocancer10340006 SO THIS MIGHT BE SOME SORT OF LIKE INFECTION SO HE GAVE ME I THINK THE MONTHS LONG AND ANOTHER AGREEMENT ON A  
ocancer10340007 KEVIN INFECTION THAT DIDN'T PROVE TO THE  AWAY SO  AND WRIGHT AND TO LAST MONDAY THE COVER 
ocancer10340008 THAT AREA  TUNG AFTER TWO WEEKS THAT DIDN'T GO AWAY AND IS LIKE WELL THERE'S NO WAY TO THE CANCER BECAUSE YOU'RE TWENTY SIX YEAR A. 
ocancer10340009 NON SMOKER YOU BARELY DRINK AND EVEN  BUT WAS  BY WHAT IS SO THE DEBT AND A WEEK LATER I DON'T THINK ALL 
ocancer10340010 IN THE WORK AND  HE ASKED ME I  IN THE OFFICE DATA SPEAKING ABOUT THE THE 
ocancer10340011 THE DIAGNOSIS AND I SAID NO  THAT WILL HOW ARE YOU DOING WELL I  I  AND THE BEGINNINGS SAINT WELL 
ocancer10340012 IT'S A APPEARS THAT YOU HAVE ONE OF THE TYPES OF CANCER 
ocancer10340013 AND THAT WAS I THOUGHT I MEMBER IS GETTING INCREASINGLY WORRIED OVER TIME WRITE A NEW COMPANY 
ocancer10340014 IN SMALL THE  SEA AND  TO INDUCE IS  WITH LAC SAID IT WILL GO AWAY RIGHT AND AS TIME PASSED AND EACH 
ocancer10340015 DRESSER OF TREATMENT DIDN'T TAKE CARE OF THE ISSUE AND GETTING MORE CLEAR THAT THIS MIGHT ACTUALLY BE A TUMOR DESPITE THE 
ocancer10340016 WORRYING THAT FEAR HAVE BUILT UP I BELIEVE WHAT IT ACTUALLY IS KNOWN AS  AS A MORE FEAR ABOUT WHAT ITS FEAR ABOUT WHAT IS  
ocancer10340017 PRIOR TO THE DIAGNOSIS I THINK MOST MYSELF I  MY BOSS BEFORE THE BUY OUT TO THE  ARE TOO BECAUSE THE SITUATION 
ocancer10340018 PART OF A LONG PAINFUL SPEAK FOR THE NEXT DAY THE  OF THE OFFICE RIGHT AND THE OTHER PEOPLE WOULD KNOW THEY NOTICE THUS MEMBER 
ocancer10340019  MY BROTHER I GUESS THE WEEK BEFORE THE BUYOUT IS TALKING ABOUT WHATEVER GENERAL  DOING NOW AS THE  
ocancer10340020 THEY LIVE IN JUNE THIS WEEK  WHATEVER EVER GET WHAT WE CAN TALK ABOUT THE END I WAS DESPITE BY THE LATEST BRAND OF THING

ocancer10340022 I DON'T THINK IT IS JUST GETTING A HEALTHY I AM BUT IT MIGHT BE AND HIS REACTION WAS THAT LIKE THE OLD THERE'S NO WAY TO BE  BECAUSE OF THE OF CANCER THAN THE REST OF US FOR ALL WELL SERVED 
ocancer10340023 I  APART FROM THIS ONE DIAGNOSIS I'M A VERY HEALTHY WHICH WILL WRITE NOT DRINKING AND SMOKING LIGHTLY DRINKING AND SMOKING 
ocancer10340024 I EVEN ON THE WHOLE  EVERYTHING TRAIN RIGHT BUT HE IS  IS NO WAY THEN DEBT 
ocancer10340025  MAKES SENSE IT'S NATURAL TO DO WITH THE  
ocancer10340026 HERS IS THE RIGHT EYE I COULD FIND IT  AS I  SURGERY ACTION CAME LESS 
ocancer10340027 UNLESS SCARED AS I CAN BEGIN TO ACCEPT THAT THIS IS THE WAY THINGS ARE I  THE DOCTOR THERE'S 
ocancer10340028 NOTHING I CAN GET A CHANCE TO ACTIONS SO I JUST THINK TO RELAX AND LET THE DOCTORS TO WORK BECAUSE IF YOU KNOW YOU DON'T HAVE ENOUGH 
ocancer10340029 EMOTIONAL ENERGY TO WORRY ABOUT IT DOES NOT TO EVEN MATCH I WAS 
ocancer10340030 PUSHING UP THE ONLY NEED A SINGLE SURGERY SO I HAD A  TO ME I  MOVING ABOUT A FIFTH OF THE FORMER  
ocancer10340031 I  HAD A  ACTION ON THE LEFT SIDE TO ITS I  SURGERY 
ocancer10340032 I  I GET VERY SIGNIFICANT ONE FOR  WON A ROUND  
ocancer10340033 I  ALL DONE IN A SINGLE PROCEDURE LAST COUPLE OF HOURS I WAS IN AND OUT I THINK TWENTY THREE AND A HALF HOURS  
ocancer10340034 I FELT VERY CALM BEFORE AND GOING TO DO NOT EXPECT APPEARANCE WITH ME WHICH WAS A GREAT BELIEF THAT HELP 
ocancer10340035 I'VE EVEN LIKE  WITH ME THINKING I CAN ONLY BE OF APPEAL ARE RIGHT AFTERWARDS AND I'M SITTING THERE LAYING MAYBE I'LL BE ABLE TO PUT SOME  TOGETHER INTO SOMETHING 
ocancer10340036 LITTLE THE PRODUCTIVE CAPITAL AND KNOW THAT I COULD HAPPEN I REMEMBER BEFORE SURGERY THEY 
ocancer10340037 AGAIN WITH SOME OF THE  WAS SHORTLY BEFORE PULLING OUT I AM ARE PASSING THROUGH THE WHOLE WAYS 
ocancer10340038 ON THE JOURNEY AND THEN COMING IN SURGERY AND NOT LEAVING SEE MUCH APART FROM  WAS DIRECTLY IN FRONT OF ME AND TO THE BOTTOM OF THE TABLE AND OTHERS LIKE A 
ocancer10340039 HELLO ON AN EYE ON THE TABLE WAS AMOUNT OF THE SET OUT TO A SOAK UP ON THE TABLE AND I WAS VERY VERY  AT THIS POINT I LIKE TO KNOW THEY ARE GUY 
ocancer10340040 BUT LIKE THIS FOR THE YEAR I.  THINKING AND THEN THAT IT HAD IN THE PALO ALTO TO BEGIN THIS IS THE  AND PUT THE 
ocancer10340041 MASCO MY FACE I WAS AT ITS OUT AND I WILL GO TO CUT HOURS LATER THE DECEMBER 
ocancer10340042 A RINGING A LOT OF PAIN CONSIDERING AN OUT OF BED UNTIL THE NEXT MORNING I 
ocancer10340043 I WALK AWAY WHEN THEY BOUGHT ME UP THROUGH THE NIGHT MAY BE  FROM THE JOURNEY TO ACTION BUT I DON'T REMEMBER THAT I  IT WASN'T UNTIL 
ocancer10340044 SOME TIME EIGHTY SEVEN  UP  FOR THE FIRST TIME I AM THE STRUGGLE LIKE ACTUALLY GETTING OUT AND GET IT OVER 
ocancer10340045 CRUM AND  MYSELF  SHOT AND HOW DIFFICULT THAT ONCE IT WOULD NOT EXPECT THAT 
ocancer10340046 ISRAEL AS THEY DON'T CHANGE THE  SO INITIALLY I THINK WHAT THE PAIN 
ocancer10340047 I  WITH NO THAT  WAS  IN AN EYE ON YEAR YOUR GENERAL  SCALE RIGHT I DON'T THINK THE PAYMENT ACTUALLY GOT WORSE BUT I LEFT JUST BECAUSE OF THE  
ocancer10340048 AND IN THE DRUG QUOTE YEAH I HAD THE  EYED RAIN RIGHT SO FOR THE  PORTION 
ocancer10340049 BUT A  TRAIN WITH THE  HERE I AM AWARE THAT MY NECK THE NEXT FIVE OR SIX DAYS SMUGGLING 
ocancer10340050   TWICE A DAY OR SO MAY CONCLUDE THAT CAME OUT AFTER A FEW DAYS TO THE FLUID IS A CLEAR ENOUGH AND THE VOLUME TO REDUCE ENOUGH 
ocancer10340051 AS A WAY TO GET OUT SOME MEMBER GETTING CAUGHT MY EYE BACKUP HOPKINS BALTIMORE AND A MEETING WITH THE 
ocancer10340052 NURSE EYE ON HAND TO SOME ACTION REMOVING IT WAS A MAJOR THINGS AS M. ONE TARGET STOCKS IT WAS A NOTE AS OF A MILD THEY KNOW THE 
ocancer10340053 A BRIEF AND UNEXPECTED SENSATION OF THAT CAME OUT I WAS AMAZED SEE IT THAT SUCH A LARGE THE VALVE IN SUCH A SMALL 
ocancer10340054 BY THIS NEW TWO WEEK MARK THE PAIN HAD DONE ANNOUNCEMENT THINLY SO THAT THAT WAS FINE WITHIN SEVERAL DAYS BUT 
ocancer10340055 THE ENERGY LEVELS AND THE ABILITY TO BE LIKE A WEEK YOU KNOW FOR MORE THAN TWELVE HOURS A DAY JUST THAT TOOK SEVERAL WEEKS RECOVER IT WAS  DAMAGE 
ocancer10340056 BOTH WITH I  TO ME REDUCING ABILITY TO EAT  THE NEW TREATY TO RECOVER AND ALSO THE SIZE OF 
ocancer10340057 THE DECISION TO THE WHILE  WHO WILL GET BETTER 
ocancer10340058 THIS TIME AND THE PATIENT NOW I REMEMBER BEING TENTATIVE SET AFTER SURGERY AND THE LIKE YOU GO IN THERE LIKE THIS GOAL 
ocancer10340059 TO ME AND HIM TO COME OUT I FELT SO MUCH WORSE THAN WHEN I WIN IT BECAUSE THE OTHER TWO ARE IT DOESN'T ACTUALLY DO ANYTHING TO YOU JUST AS A WHOLE 
ocancer10340060 WHILE THE COMPANY DOESN'T HAVE ANY IMPACT UNTIL ITS PAST SIZE AND GONE AND IS BRINGING ON EVERY THE CRITICAL STUDENT BODY RIGHT BUT ITS MEMBERS 
ocancer10340061 BEFORE AND I FELT I ACTUALLY FINE AND AFTER IT WAS JUST COULDN'T DO ANYTHING FOR TWO WEEKS AND THAT BUT THAT DID IMPROVE SLOWLY 
ocancer10340062 BUT I DROPPED ABOUT WHAT TENNECO POUNDS IN THE FIRST WEEK ITS LEAST AFTER ABOUT A DAY OR SO AS OF THE DRINK SOME 
ocancer10340063 IT'S BEEN COOL ROTH A HIGH TEMPERATURE WITH AN AWFUL BUT AT LEAST THE OLDER THAT  THAT WORK BY 
ocancer10340064 EVERY DAY FOR HIGHS AND TYPE OF APPLE SAUCE  ROTH AND  BY  EIGHTY SEVEN I WAS ON A DIET OF APPLE'S  ROTH AND  
ocancer10340065 I  IT IS MAYBE AFTER ABOUT TWO OR THREE WEEKS I COULD HAVE SOME SOFTER FOODS 
ocancer10340066 THE BAKED BEANS SALMON A VERY VERY TENDER CHICKEN THAT NO DIFFICULTY WITH TASTE BUT MY 
ocancer10340067 TONY WAS DURING THE FIRST FEW WEEKS EVEN TODAY IS JUST RANGE AND EVERY TIME I THINK I CAN TELL THAT THERE IS A VERY  
ocancer10340068 LEAR AND DOWNS FROM THE LEFT AND RIGHT SITE BY RETAINING I CAN'T HAVE A LITTLE BIT LESS KNOWLEDGE FROM WHERE IT IS MY MOUTH 
ocancer10340069 IT'S SURPRISING THAT IT MIGHT BUY THAT SO OFTEN BECAUSE THERE'S LESS THAT THEIR TO BITE I. BUT YEAH 
ocancer10340070 I DIDN'T BITE HOPKINS TO MEET THIS WEEK OF AUGUST FOR A COUPLE OF MEETINGS AND SHE DIDN'T MEET SOME EXERCISES UNTIL THE PROBABILITY USUALLY BECAUSE OF THE 
ocancer10340071 RATHER SMALL AREA THAT WAS THE SECOND I HAVE MANY LONG TERM IMPACT OF SPEECH MAKING  ABOUT AS GOOD AS IT USED TO 
ocancer10340072 MOST OF THOSE WISHING TO THE DIFFERENCE RIGHT BUT THAT'S  I  ALSO SEEING A FISCAL THEIR BEST THERE'S A WHOLE 
ocancer10340073 POST AS I HAD TO DO THEIR MOST TO REGAIN THE NECK ABILITY AND THE  
ocancer10340074 I'M NOT SURE YOUR   WILL AGAIN FOR THOSE THINGS WOULD LIKE THIS IS A RATHER LARGE AN UNEXPECTED CHANGE 
ocancer10340075 THEN IT IT CHANGES THE OUTLOOK FROM THERE ON RIGHT I THINK THE VALUE AND WHAT YOU CARE ABOUT 
ocancer10340076 AND WHAT YOU REALLY NO LONGER TOLERATE ANY KIND OF NONSENSE HE WILL EACH TIME ON ONCE YOU'VE COME SO CLOSE TO 
ocancer10340077 LOSING EVERYTHING YEAH SO TO COME PSYCHOLOGICALLY EMOTIONALLY PERSONALLY I'M NOT SURE THAT YOU EVER GET BACK TO WHAT WAS NORMAL 
ocancer10340078 BUT PRETTY SOON THE KIND OF FEEL LIKE THIS IS WHY I AM NOW AND THE  THAT PHYSICALLY 
ocancer10340079 IT WAS A FEW MONTHS I  I STILL HAVE BEEN EVERY HAVE TO DO AFTER SURGERY THE ABSOLUTELY CRITICAL YEAH I WOULD NOT 
ocancer10340080 I  MYSELF THE FIRST TWO WEEKS AFTER SURGERY I  WITH ME ONE OF THEM AT EVERY EVERYONE GOT  UP 
ocancer10340081 I'M LUCKY ENOUGH TO LIVE STILL THE NEARBY WERE GREW UP SO I AND HAVE PARENTS KNOW WHO CARE AND WOULD BE THE  
ocancer10340082 WE'RE IN A VERY WARY EYE  EVERY TIME THIS KIND OF LAW AND ALL OR NOTHING MAKE IT A BREAK THE EVENT 
ocancer10340083 THIS COULD BE THE TIME I FIND OUT THAT I ACTUALLY DO FOR CANCER AGAIN RIGHT NOW THEY TAKE YOUR WEIGHT AND A BLOOD PRESSURE AND  
ocancer10340084 THE RIGHT AND MY BLOOD PRESSURE TO ME LIKE THIRTY POINT  EVERY TIME BEFORE I THOUGHT EMPLOYMENT AND IT ISN'T OF ICY REGULAR DOCTOR 
ocancer10340085 YEAH YEAH BUT LIKELY THAT IT DIDN'T DIDN'T COME BACK IT'S BEEN TWO YEARS NOW THE LAST LAUGH TRACK 
ocancer10340086 THE TWO YEAR ONE THAT THE BENCHMARK WAS  I  YOU FEEL LIKE FROM NOW ON THE BEACHES MORE YOU ACTUALLY ROUTINE RIGHT 
ocancer10340087 MORE LIKE THIS IS JUST A PART OF MY  BY ANNUAL OR ANNUAL MEETINGS IT'S REALLY NOT LIKELY TO MOUNT ANYTHING TO DO THIS TO MAKE SURE IT'S A HEALTHY 
ocancer10340088 BEFORE THIS IS NOW IT WAS MORE TO MAKE SURE THAT I AM HEALTHY I DON'T ACTUALLY I  CURRENTLY HAVE CANCER AND STILL TO COME 
ocancer10340089 ACTIVE LAPSE  NOTED TIME TO GET A DIAGNOSIS LIKE THIS RIGHT BUT THIS IS PROBABLY THE 
ocancer10340090 POSSIBLE TIME EVER GET WHAT THEY ARE THINKING ABOUT THE TREND IS AVAILABLE NOW AS OPPOSED TO EVEN DECADES AGO THAT THERE THERE ARE TREATMENTS 
ocancer10340091 WRIGHT THOUSAND YEARS AGO NOTHING  IN DECADES AGO THE WORK IT REALLY NEED VIABLE TREATMENTS THAT HAD A HIGH SUCCESS RATE 
ocancer10340092 WITH A MINIMAL ARE LOW COMPLICATIONS I WAS NOW THEY'RE THERE ARE GOOD JOBS AT THE  WITH WHATEVER DOCTORS 
ocancer10340093 RICHMOND THEIR PHYSICAL THERAPY AND DOCTORS OR YEAR MEDICAL PRACTITIONERS  TREES FALL THE ADVICE OF RECOVERY GOES FURTHER
