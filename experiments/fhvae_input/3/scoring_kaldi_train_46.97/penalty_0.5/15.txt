ocancer10220013 HALF AND THAT DEBT TO STEAL FROM ITS MAIN INSTABILITY AND WE THINK WE'RE ALL IN MORAL RIGHT HAND I DON'T THINK ABOUT AFTER AWHILE THINK ABOUT DEFINITELY 
ocancer10220014 I  FACES THAT I REALIZED I MIGHT YESTERDAY YOU KNOW THAT SOUNDS SILLY BUT I WAS USING FOR ME REALIZE A MORE 
ocancer10220015 AND AS THE POSSIBILITY THAT COULD HAPPEN SO BUT BEING ABLE TO A SHARE FOR FAMILY FRIENDS AS SEVERE AS  OUT

ocancer10220023  CURRENT LOSS OF CHILD CARE FOR GAINED EFFECTIVE OUT TO OTHERS THAT ARE NOT SPEND TIME WITH BECAUSE A SO SO FOCUSED ON WHAT THEY DON'T HAVE ANY MORE IN THAT SOUGHT

ocancer10220027 PER HOUR FOR THE QUARTER WHILE THAT WAS THAT I DREAMED OF MIND AND I HAD NO IDEA TO THE MEETINGS WHERE COME AFTER HAVING CHEMOTHERAPY 
ocancer10220028 RADIATION  AND GONE SO THE BOSS'S OF THEIR DRESSES THEATER PEOPLE WHO'VE HAD  OR 
ocancer10220029 ABOUT TO HAVE ONE OR MAYBE FRIENDS AND FAMILY WHO ARE DOING RESEARCH IN TRYING TO SUPPORT SOMEBODY WHO'S GONE THROUGH ONE IS ABOUT TO GO THROUGH ONE SO NEWS AND INFORMATION SERVICES 
ocancer10220030 BASED ON THINGS I'VE BEEN THROUGH LAST FIVE YEARS I  YOU MIGHT NOT EXPECT THE THINGS I WAS TOLD THAT MIGHT HAPPEN SO   
ocancer10220031 FOR TIGHTER THAN IS AGAIN I  SIDE EFFECTS OF ALL THIS STUFF IS BAD NUMBER ONE THINGS IN LIFE  COME ALIVE EVEN COMPLAINED 
ocancer10220032 PEOPLE THINK I HAVE ALWAYS PROBLEMS BUT CAN'T GO I FEEL SO THE DOWNSIDE OF TREATMENT ISSUE THAT HAS THE WHOLE POINT OF  THAT'S LIFE OPPORTUNITY 
ocancer10220033 SO SIDE EFFECTS LIES ON THE ARRESTS ARE ONES THAT HAD ACTUALLY COMPANY NEARLY ON ITS TWO DOZEN BUT THEY ARE ONES THAT HAVE  
ocancer10220034 AXA FIRST WAS THE SHARPEST CALL OR MEET SIGN IN MY  FOR SOME EVEN DURING TREATMENT AND PREVENTION MUCH AS A  A SUDDEN SURGE 
ocancer10220035 THE PAINFUL SURGE MULLER BODY I.  IS BECOMING WEEK ALL AT ONCE AN OUNCE ON SOMETHING THAT CAN SPECIFICALLY BECAUSE I HAVE A FEW OTHER VEHICLES 
ocancer10220036 SPOTTING A SOCIAL RADIATION A COMBINATION OF SOME PEOPLE DOES CAUSE OR RESIGN AND THUS OF THE WORLD THAT IT'S IT'S NOT  
ocancer10220037  IS JUST A AND NOT FUN ESPECIALLY  FOR SOMETHING THAT MUCH IN DOUBT THAT I HAPPEN TO ME I  ISSUES WERE WEAKENED BY CHEMOTHERAPY 
ocancer10220038 WE  TISSUES FOUR YEARS IN YEARS TO COME AND  AIR CONDITIONER THIS LAST SUMMER AS  
ocancer10220039 OTHER COMMISSIONERS ASKING FOR HELP IT SHOULD HAVE A HEAVY AMOUNT I BOUGHT FROM A LOCAL A HOME STORE AND AUGUST INSTALLING AN OUTLOOK AND  
ocancer10220040 THE AIR CONDITIONERS ONE HAND AND  MUSCLES AND  SHOULDER AND HAD SURGERY FOR THAT I  LAST BE AS  AND SAY MUCH ABOUT IT 
ocancer10220041 BUT SEARS IS A WEEKEND CURRENTLY AND A BIG EFFECT ON ME I  ANALYSTS CITE MY FACE OF  
ocancer10220042 VERY LONG AS ALL THE ENTIRE SAID MY FACE AN ACTING   PLAYING IT BECOMES  AND HER START  FOR A MUCH SO I 
ocancer10220043 TO DO AN  THAT A SECOND BUT ONE OF THESE THINGS LATEST HAPPENED PROBABLY THE LAST SIX MONTHS IS A CONDITION CALLED  
ocancer10220044 I  OR  AND SAY MY SEAT OR SO WHILE WHO ACTUALLY HAVE THE MUSCLES TIGHTEN IT HAS AN AMPLE I WANT TO DO THAT BY FIAT 
ocancer10220045 AND SO MY MUSCLES ARE COSTLY AND BATTLE THE TIGERS ARE FIGHTING BACK AND FORTH  STREET BUT THE  CONSTANTLY  TOP OF A HARD 
ocancer10220046 THE BACKUP TRIED THREE ROUNDS OF OF HAVING NO TALKS DONE MY NECK AND TO RAISE EXPENSIVE PROCESS 
ocancer10220047 AND IT WEAKENS MUSCLE AND ALLOWS FUNCTIONS WILL SUFFER ME THAT MAKES ME NERVOUS I HAVE A WEEK MOST OF THE NEXT  CAN SUPPORT MYSELF SO 
ocancer10220048 A WAY THAT'S THE  ARIAS IS A NEW CAN'T HAVE THE SPACE  PARKINSON IS IN MY NECK SOMETIMES BECAUSE I GET THESE  OF BOB  
ocancer10220049 MOTIONS WITH  A FARMER AND I CAN'T SAY I CAN'T HELP  THE MUSCLE IN ON THAT THAT THE  PIECES VERY ON 
ocancer10220050 I BEGAN SIDE EFFECT OF ALL THE TREATMENT OF YEARS AGO TO START ISSUES ALL THAT MOVEMENT IS AFFECTING THE  AS WELL AS MORE PROBLEMS BUT  
ocancer10220051 IDEAS SO YOU HAVE SIDE EFFECTS FROM THAT THE YEN ON THE LIFE  TO TALK TO ENCOURAGE PEOPLE SO AS TO THE GLASS THEY SAY YOU KNOW HOW YOU DO 
ocancer10220052 I. S. MARKETS LIKE  COMPLAIN BUT NOW IT'S NOT WORTH THE  TALK ABOUT THE POSITIVE THINGS THAT AROUND MY LIFE 
ocancer10220053 AND FOR THOSE WHO HAD RADIATION IS PART OF YOUR TREATMENT  YOU HAVE RADIATION I HAVE  IDEAS FOR  ARE IMPORTANT I'VE LEARNED 
ocancer10220054 THE  HAD THIS TO HAVE NOT HAD AN ORAL CARE AND LOS  WHICH IS RUNNING ARE FALLING APART SO A 
ocancer10220055 THE BLAST AT SOME EARLY ON A FRIEND OF THE  WILL GIVE ME SOMETHING CALLED A  FURNISH AND  THE BASIS OF SOMETHING 
ocancer10220056 IT TENDS TO DO WITH THE HIGH SIERRA  PERHAPS BUT THAT FOR  DOES IS ALLOW YOU TO ACTUALLY HAVE IT CAN SLOWS 
ocancer10220057  THAT HELPS TO STRENGTHEN THOSE ALSO HELPS TO AVOID U. K. EQUITIES AS WELL SO YOU HAVE THE FLOOR AS A POISON THE SAME TIME AS 
ocancer10220058 USED PROPERLY CONNECTION  A BIT I HAVE MY TEETH THAN FOUR TIMES A YEAR AND IT'S ABOUT TWICE AS OFTEN AS RECOMMENDED BUT WHEN YOU HAVE A LOCK US ALIVE 
ocancer10220059 IT'S LIKE A FRACTION OF A MOUSE ALL IT IS ACTUALLY BAD FOR YOUR TEETH AND THAT  SO  FOUR TIMES  ARE PROPERLY 
ocancer10220060 AFTER EVERY TIME I EAT A FOOD ALWAYS WATER PICK ANOTHER OTHER TYPE OF A PRODUCT LIKE THE  THROUGH THEM ACTUALLY ONE FOR TRAVEL 
ocancer10220061 ONE INDICATION WHEN  EVERYWHERE I  MOUSE OUT TO  THREE FOUR TIMES A DAY OF TO KEEP THAT STUFF 
ocancer10220062 MY TEETH I CAN'T AFFORD CARRIES  TO HOW MUCH TIME  CAN'T CLEAN  SO IT'S WORTHWHILE HAVE A   A 
ocancer10220063 NOTHING TO THINK ABOUT IS TALKING TO A  START TALKING TO SOME BE A HEALTHY START GOING TO QUALITY AND NUTRITION TO BE ABLE TO  
ocancer10220064 THE BODY  ABILITY TO HAVE  THE LAST SUCH TO THOSE IN AND YOU'RE IN SUPPORT TO BOND AUCTION  BONE GROWTH SO YOU WANT TO LOOK AT HAVING

ocancer10280082 THE ANSWER QUESTIONS I GO THROUGH THIS PROCESS I WISH HIM WELL I  HER 
ocancer10340001 I WAS DIAGNOSED WITH 
ocancer10340002   TONGUE AND BACK IN MARCH TO SIXTEEN OF THE TWO YEARS AGO AT THE AGE OF TWENTY SIX I THINK I NOTICED 
ocancer10340003 A SMALL BUMP MY TONGUE ONE MORNING AND EARLY IN JANUARY AFTER THE NEW YEAR AND IS LIKE THAT'S VERY STRANGE FOR  A LARGE SIDE 
ocancer10340004  AWAY AND DIDN'T THEN BY I  LATE JANUARY AND THE MONTH WHEN C. I  
ocancer10340005 I. T. AND T.'S BOTH ME AND SAID MILITARY STRANGE AND I ASKED TO TEST A SWAP OF IT 
ocancer10340006 SO THIS MIGHT BE SOME SORT OF  INFECTION SO HE GAVE ME I THINK THE  AND ANOTHER AGREEMENT ON A  
ocancer10340007 KEVIN INFECTION THAT DIDN'T PROVE TO THE  AWAY SO  AND WRIGHT AND TO LAST MONDAY THE COVER 
ocancer10340008 THAT AREA  TUNG AFTER TWO WEEKS THAT DIDN'T GO AWAY AND IS LIKE WELL THERE'S NO WAY  CANCER BECAUSE YOU'RE TWENTY SIX YEAR A. 
ocancer10340009 NON SMOKER YOU BARELY DRINK AND EVEN  BUT WAS  BY WHAT IS SO THE DEBT AND A WEEK LATER I DON'T THINK ALL 
ocancer10340010 THE WORK AND  HE ASKED ME I  IN THE OFFICE DATA SPEAKING ABOUT THE THE 
ocancer10340011 THE DIAGNOSIS AND I SAID NO  WILL HOW ARE YOU DOING WELL I  I  AND HE BEGINS SAINT WELL 
ocancer10340012 IT'S A APPEARS THAT YOU HAVE ONE OF THE TYPES OF CANCER 
ocancer10340013 AND THAT WAS I THOUGHT I MEMBER IS GETTING INCREASINGLY WORRIED OVER TIME WRITE A NEW COMPANY 
ocancer10340014 A SMALL THE  SEA AND AGO THE DISHES  ACCIDENT GO AWAY RIGHT AND AS TIME PASSED AND EACH 
ocancer10340015 DRESSER OF TREATMENT DIDN'T TAKE CARE OF THE ISSUE AND GETTING MORE CLEAR THAT THIS MIGHT ACTUALLY BE A TUMOR DESPITE THE 
ocancer10340016 WORRYING THAT FEAR HAVE BUILT UP I BELIEVE WHAT IT ACTUALLY IS KNOWN AS  AS A MORE FEAR ABOUT WHAT ITS FEAR ABOUT WHAT IS 
ocancer10340017 PRIOR TO THE DIAGNOSIS I THINK MOST MYSELF I  MY BOSS BEFORE THE BUY OUT  ARE TOO BECAUSE THE SITUATION 
ocancer10340018 PART OF A LONG PAINFUL SPEAK   OF THE OFFICE RIGHT AND THE OTHER PEOPLE WOULD KNOW THEY NOTICE  
ocancer10340019  MY BROTHER I GUESS THE WEEK BEFORE THE BUYOUT IS TALKING ABOUT WHATEVER GENERAL  DOING NOW AS THE  
ocancer10340020 THEY LIVE IN JUNE THIS WEEK  WHATEVER EVER GET WHAT WE TALK ABOUT THE END I WAS DESPITE BY THE LATEST  THING 
ocancer10340021 I ACTUALLY SOLD OFF MY TONGUE ABOUT A MONTH AFTER IT HAS NO WAY SOME OF THE BUY OUT A LID ON THIS WEEK JUST LUCK OUT COULD BE CANCER 
ocancer10340022 I DON'T THINK IT IS JUST GETTING A HEALTHY AND THAT IT MIGHT BE AND HIS REACTION WAS THAT LIKE THE OLD THERE'S NO WAY TO BE  BECAUSE OF THE OF CANCER THAN THE REST OF US FOR ALL  
ocancer10340023 I  APART FROM THIS ONE DIAGNOSIS I'M A VERY HEALTHY INDIVIDUAL RIGHT NOT DRINKING AND SMOKING LIGHTLY DRINKING AND SMOKING 
ocancer10340024 EVEN ON THE WHOLE  EVERYTHING TRADING WRIGHT THE  IS NO WAY THEN DEBT 
ocancer10340025  MAKES SENSE IT'S NATURAL TO  
ocancer10340026 HERS IS THE RIGHT EYE I COULD FIND IT  AS I  SURGERY ACTUALLY BECAME LESS 
ocancer10340027 UNLESS SCARED AS I CAN BEGIN TO ACCEPT THE WAY THINGS ARE I  DOCTOR THERE'S 
ocancer10340028 NOTHING I THINK YOU CAN SWITCH AND SO I JUST THINK TO RELAX AND LET THE DOCTORS TO WORK BECAUSE IF YOU KNOW YOU DON'T HAVE ENOUGH 
ocancer10340029 EMOTIONAL ENERGY TO WORRY ABOUT IT DOES NOT TO EVEN MATCH I WAS 
ocancer10340030 PUSHING UP THE ONLY NEED A SINGLE SURGERY SO I HAD A  ME I  ABOUT A FIFTH OF THE FORMER  
ocancer10340031 I  HAD A  ACTION ON THE LEFT SIDE TO I  SURGERY 
ocancer10340032 I  I GET VERY SIGNIFICANT ONE FOR  AROUND 
ocancer10340033 I  ALL DONE IN A SINGLE PROCEDURE LAST COUPLE OF HOURS I WAS IN AND OUT I THINK TWENTY THREE AND A HALF HOURS

ocancer10340035 I'VE EVEN LIKE  ME THINK I CAN ONLY BE OF APPEAL ARE RIGHT AFTERWARDS AND I'M SITTING THERE LAYING MAYBE I'LL BE ABLE TO  TOGETHER INTO SOMETHING 
ocancer10340036 LITTLE THE PRODUCTIVE CAPITAL AND KNOW THAT I COULD HAPPEN I REMEMBER BEFORE SURGERY THEY 
ocancer10340037 AGAIN WITH SOME OF THE  WAS SHORTLY BEFORE PULLING OUT I AM ARE PASSING THROUGH THE WHOLE WAYS 
ocancer10340038 ON THE JOURNEY AND THEN COMING IN SURGERY AND NOT LEAVING SEE MUCH APART FROM  WAS DIRECTLY IN FRONT OF ME AND TO THE BOTTOM OF THE TABLE AND OTHERS LIKE A 
ocancer10340039 HELLO ON THE TABLE WAS AMOUNT OF THE SET OUT TO ASSAULT ON THE TABLE AND I WAS VERY VERY  AT THIS POINT I LIKE TO KNOW THEY ARE GUY 
ocancer10340040 BUT LIKE THIS FOR THE YEAR I.  THINKING AND THEN  THE PALO ALTO TO BEGIN THIS IS THE  AND PUT THE 
ocancer10340041 MASCO MY FACE I WAS AT ITS OUT AND I WILL GO TO CUT HOURS LATER THE DECEMBER 
ocancer10340042 A RINGING A LOT OF PAIN CONSIDERING AN OUT OF BED UNTIL THE NEXT MORNING 
ocancer10340043 I WALK AWAY WHEN THEY BOUGHT ME UP THROUGH THE NIGHT MAY BE  FROM THE JOURNEY TO ACTION BUT I DON'T REMEMBER THAT I  IT WASN'T UNTIL 
ocancer10340044 SOME TIME EIGHTY SEVEN  UP  THE FIRST TIME I AM THE STRUGGLE LIKE ACTUALLY GETTING OUT AND GET IT OVER 
ocancer10340045 CRUM AND  MYSELF  SHOT AND HOW DIFFICULT THAT ONCE IT WOULD NOT EXPECT THAT 
ocancer10340046 ISRAEL AS THEY DON'T CHANGE THE  SO INITIALLY I THINK WHAT THE PAIN 
ocancer10340047 I  WITH NO THAT  WAS  IN AN EYE ON YEAR YOUR GENERAL  SCALE RIGHT I  ACTUALLY GOT WORSE BUT I LEFT JUST BECAUSE OF THE  
ocancer10340048 AND IN THE DRUG QUOTE YEAH I HAD THE  EYED RAIN RIGHT SO FOR THE  PORTION 
ocancer10340049 BUT A  TRAIN WITH THE  HERE I AM AWARE THAT MY NECK THE NEXT FIVE OR SIX DAYS SMUGGLING 
ocancer10340050   TWICE A DAY OR SO MAY CONCLUDE THAT CAME OUT AFTER A FEW DAYS TO THE FOOD IS A CLEAR ENOUGH AND THE VOLUME TO REDUCE ENOUGH 
ocancer10340051 AS A WAY TO GET OUT SOME MEMBER GETTING CAUGHT MY EYE BACKUP HOPKINS BALTIMORE AND A MEETING WITH THE 
ocancer10340052 NURSE ON HAND TO  REMOVING IT WAS A MAJOR THINGS AS M. ONE TARGET STOCKS IT WAS A NOTICE OF A MILD IN A 
ocancer10340053 BRIEFS AND UNEXPECTED SENSATION OF THAT CAME OUT I WAS AMAZED SEE THAT SUCH A LARGE THE VALVE IN SUCH A SMALL 
ocancer10340054 BY THIS NEW TWO WEEK MARK THE PAIN HAD DONE ANNOUNCEMENT THINLY SO THAT THAT WAS FINE WITHIN SEVERAL DAYS BUT 
ocancer10340055 THE ENERGY LEVELS AND THE ABILITY TO BE LIKE A WEAK NOTE FOR MORE THAN TWELVE HOURS A DAY THIS THAT TOOK SEVERAL WEEKS RECOVER IT WAS  DAMAGE 
ocancer10340056 BOTH WITH I  TO ME REDUCING ABILITY TO EAT ACTUALLY GET  TO RECOVER AND ALSO THE SIZE OF 
ocancer10340057 THE DECISION TO THE WHILE  WHO WILL GET BETTER 
ocancer10340058 EXXON AND THE PATIENT NOW I REMEMBER BEING TENTATIVE SET AFTER SURGERY AND THE LIKE YOU GO IN THERE LIKE THIS GOAL 
ocancer10340059 TO ME AND HIM TO COME OUT I FELT SO MUCH WORSE THAN ONE WHEN IT BECAUSE THE OTHER TWO ARE DOESN'T ACTUALLY DO ANYTHING TO YOU JUST AS  
ocancer10340060 WHILE THE COMPANY DOESN'T HAVE ANY IMPACT UNTIL ITS PAST SIZE AND GONE AND IS BRINGING ON EVERY THE CRITICAL STUDENT BODY WRIGHT  
ocancer10340061 BEFORE AND I FELT LIKE A FINE AND AFTER IT WAS JUST COULDN'T DO ANYTHING FOR BILLY SUMMIT BUT THAT DID IMPROVE  
ocancer10340062 BUT I THOUGHT ABOUT WHAT TENNECO POUNDS IN THE FIRST WEEK AS LEAST AFTER ABOUT A DAY OR SO AS OF THE DRINK SOME 
ocancer10340063 SOME COOL ROTH A HIGH TEMPERATURE WITH AN AWFUL BUT AT LEAST THE OLDER THAT  THAT WORK BY 
ocancer10340064 EVERY DAY FOR RISING TIDE OF APPLE SAUCE  ROTH AND  BY  EIGHTY SEVEN I WAS ON A DIET OF APPLE'S  ROTH AND

ocancer10340066 THE BAKED BEANS SALMON A VERY VERY TENDER CHICKEN THAT NO DIFFICULTY WITH TASTE BUT MY 
ocancer10340067 TONY WAS DURING THE FIRST FEW WEEKS EVEN TODAY IS JUST RANGE AND EVERY TIME I THINK I CAN TELL THAT THERE IS A  
ocancer10340068 WE'RE IN DALLAS FROM THE LEFT AND RIGHT SITE BY RETAINING I CAN'T HAVE A LITTLE BIT LESS KNOWLEDGE FROM WHERE IT IS MY MOUTH 
ocancer10340069 IT'S SURPRISING TO BUY THAT SO OFTEN BECAUSE THERE'S LESS THAT THEIR TO BITE I. BUT YEAH 
ocancer10340070 I  HOPKINS TO MEET THIS WEEK OF AUGUST FOR A COUPLE OF MEETINGS AND SHE DIDN'T MEET SOME EXERCISES UNTIL THE PROBABILITY USUALLY BECAUSE OF THE 
ocancer10340071 RATHER SMALL AREA THAT WAS THE SECOND I HAVE MANY LONG TERM IMPACT OF SPEECH MAKING  ABOUT IS THE EAST 
ocancer10340072 MOST OF THOSE WISHING TO THE DIFFERENCE RIGHT BUT THAT'S  I  ALSO SEEING A FISCAL THEIR BEST THERE'S A WHOLE 
ocancer10340073 POST AS I HAD TO DO THEIR MOST TO REGAIN THE NECK ABILITY AND  
ocancer10340074 I'M NOT SURE YOUR   WILL AGAIN FOR THOSE THINGS WOULD LIKE THIS IS A RATHER LARGE AN UNEXPECTED CHANGE 
ocancer10340075 THEN IT  THE OUTLOOK FROM THERE ON RIGHT I THINK THE VALUE AND WHAT YOU CARE ABOUT 
ocancer10340076 AND WHAT YOU REALLY NO LONGER TOLERATE ANY KIND OF NONSENSE HE WILL EACH TIME ON ONCE YOU'VE COME SO CLOSE TO 
ocancer10340077 LOSING EVERYTHING YEAH SO TO COME PSYCHOLOGICALLY EMOTIONALLY PERSONALLY I'M NOT SURE THAT YOU EVER GET BACK TO WHAT WAS NORMAL 
ocancer10340078 BUT PRETTY SOON BECAUSE OF THE LIKE THIS IS WHY I AM NOW AND THE  THAT PHYSICALLY 
ocancer10340079 IT WAS A FEW MONTHS I STILL HAVE BEEN EVERY HAVE TO DO AFTER SURGERY THE ABSOLUTELY CRITICAL YEAH I WOULD NOT 
ocancer10340080 I  MYSELF THE FIRST TWO WEEKS AFTER SURGERY I  WITH ME ONE OF THEM AT EVERY EVERYONE GOT  UP

ocancer10340087 MORE LIKE THIS IS JUST A PART OF MY  BY ANNUAL OR ANNUAL MEETINGS IT'S REALLY NOT LIKELY TO MOUNT ANYTHING TO DO THIS TO MAKE SURE IT'S A HEALTHY 
ocancer10340088 BEFORE THIS IS NOW IT WAS MORE TO MAKE SURE THE AND HEALTHY I DON'T ACTUALLY I  CURRENTLY HAVE CANCER AND STILL TO COME 
ocancer10340089 ACTIVE LAPSE  NOTED TIME TO GET A DIAGNOSIS LIKE THIS RIGHT BUT THIS IS PROBABLY THE 
ocancer10340090 POSSIBLE TIME EVER GET THIS THING ABOUT THE TREND IS AVAILABLE NOW AS OPPOSED TO EVEN DECADES AGO THAT THERE THERE ARE TREATMENTS
