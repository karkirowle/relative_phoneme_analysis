ocancer10220032 I'M PEOPLE THINK I HAVE ALWAYS PROBLEMS BUT CAN'T GO HIGHS YOU KNOW SO THE DOWNSIDE OF TREATMENT IT SHOULD LIVE HAS A WHOLE POINT OF TREATMENTS TO EXTEND THAT'S A LIFE OPPORTUNITY 
ocancer10220033  SO SIDE EFFECTS LIES ON THEIR AREA ARRESTS ARE ONES THAT HAD I ACTUALLY PROBABLY NEARLY ON ITS TWO DOZEN BUT THE BIGGER ONES THAT HAVE  
ocancer10220034 AXA FIRST WAS THE SHARPEST CALL OR MEET SIGN IN MY  FOR WALK FOR SOME EVEN DURING TREATMENT I PUT MUCH IN MY CHESS AND BE THE SUDDEN SURGE 
ocancer10220035 THE PAINFUL SURGE MULLER BODY I.  NON  IS BECOMING WEEK ALL AT ONCE AND THAT'S ON SOMETHING THAT CAME SPECIFICALLY BECAUSE I HAD A FEW OF THEIR VEHICLES 
ocancer10220036 SPOTTING WITH CERVICAL RADIATION A COMBINATION AND SOME PEOPLE DOES CAUSE OR RESIGN AND THUS OF THE WORD THAT IT'S IT'S NOT  
ocancer10220037 ONLY IT'S JUST A AND NOT FUN ESPECIALLY THE MAXSAVER SOMETHING THAT MENTIONED OUT THAT I HAPPEN TO ME I  MY TEACHERS WERE WEAKENED BY CHEMOTHERAPY 
ocancer10220038 WE CAN  TISSUES FOUR YEARS IN YEARS TO COME AND  AIR CONDITIONER THIS LAST OF SUMMER I WAS  
ocancer10220039 UNDER COMMISSIONER WAS ASKING FOR HELP IT SHOULD HAVE A HEAVY AMOUNT I BOUGHT FROM A LOCAL A HOME STORE AND AUGUST INSTALLING AN AMOUNT BROKE AND  
ocancer10220040 THE AIR CONDITIONERS ONE HAND AND TORTURE MUSCLES AND I OFFER MY SHOULDER AND HAD SURGERY FOR THAT I MIGHT ACT ON THE LAST BE AS  RACE AND SAY MUCH ABOUT IT 
ocancer10220041 BUT SEARS ISSUES ARE WEAK AND CURRENTLY AND HAVE THE EFFECT ON ME I HAVE SOME  ANALYSTS CITE MY FACE OF  
ocancer10220042 VERY LONG AS ALL THE ENTIRE SAID MY FACE AN ACTING GOALS SENATE PAINFUL TEAM PLAYING IT BECOMES AN EYE AND HER SIDE GONE FROM THE OFFER MUCH SO I 
ocancer10220043 TO DO AN  THAT A SECOND BUT MY THE BIGGEST THINGS LATELY HAS HAPPENED COMPANY LAST LAST SIX MONTHS IS A CONDITION CALLED SOCIALIST  
ocancer10220044 I  OR  AS MIKE  AND SAY MY SEAT OR SO WHILE WHO ACTUALLY HAVE THE MUSCLES TIGHTEN IT HAS AN ANGLE MY WANTS TO DO THAT BY FIGHTING 
ocancer10220045 AND SO MY MUSCLES ARE COSTLY AND BATTLE THE TIGERS ARE FIGHTING BACK AND FORTH KEEP MY NEXT RATE BUT THEY SPOUSE AND COSTLY AS IN MOST OF HIS TOP OF A HARD 
ocancer10220046 THE BACK OF TRIED THREE ROUNDS OF OF HAVING A BOW TALKS DONE MY NECK AND TO RAISE EXPENSIVE PROCESS 
ocancer10220047 AND IT WEAKENS MUSCLE AND IS A LOT OF FUNCTIONS WILL SUFFER ME THAT MAKES ME NERVOUS I HAVE A WEEK MUSCLES MY NEXT  OVER SOMETHING I CAN'T SUPPORT MYSELF SO I 
ocancer10220048 A WAY THAT'S THE WORD PART IS IS A NEW CAN'T HAVE THIS BUT IT DOES AT PAR CONCERNS IN MY NECK SOMETIMES BECAUSE I GET THESE  OF BOBBY AND 
ocancer10220049 MOTIONS WITH A RICH MAKE A FARMER I. AND I CAN'T SAY I CAN'T HELP US OF  NARROW BE THE MUSCLE IN ON THAT THAT THE  PIECES VERY ON 
ocancer10220050 I BEGAN SIDE EFFECT OF ALL THE TREATMENT OF YEARS AGO TO START TISSUES ALL THAT MOVEMENT IS AFFECTING THE NECK AS WELL I WAS MORE PROBLEMS BUT  
ocancer10220051 IDEAS SO YOU HAVE SIDE EFFECTS FROM THAT THE YEN ON THE LIFE  TO TALK TO YOU AND ENCOURAGE PEOPLE SO IT'S A GOOD THE GLASS THEY SAY YOU KNOW HOW YOU DO 
ocancer10220052 I. S. MARKETS LIKE THE SHY COMPLAIN BUT NOW IT'S NOT WORTH THE  TALK ABOUT THE POSITIVE THINGS THAT THERE WERE NO MY LIFE 
ocancer10220053 AND FOR THOSE WHO HAD RADIATION IS PART OF YOUR TREATMENT TO  YOU HAVE RADIATION I HAVE SOME EXTRA IDEAS FOR USING  ARE IMPORTANT I'VE LEARNED 
ocancer10220054 I ADMIT TO GO WHO'VE HAD THIS TO HAVE NOT HAD THE ORAL CARE AND LOST THEIR TEETH OF WHICH IS RUNNING ARE FALLING APART SO A 
ocancer10220055 HIS LOSS TO HAVE SOMEONE EARLY ON A FRIEND OF THE DELTA JUSTICES IT WILL GIVE ME SOMETHING CALLED A  ON FLOYD FURNISH AND AS A  THE BASIS OF SOMETHING 
ocancer10220056 IT TENDS TO DO WITH THE HIGH SIERRA  THING PERHAPS I  WITH THAT FORD RIGHTS DOES IS ALLOWS YOU TO ACTUALLY HAVE IT CAN SLOWS 
ocancer10220057 NARROW STATION OF HER TEETH IT HELPS TO STRENGTHEN THOSE IT ALSO HELPS TO AVOID DECAY OF THE TEETH AS WELL SO YOU HAVE THE FLOOR AS A POISON THE SAME TIME AS 
ocancer10220058 USED PROPERLY CAN AND SHOULD HELP IT QUITE A BIT I HAVE MY TEETH THAN FOUR TIMES A YEAR AND IT'S ABOUT TWICE AS OFTEN AS RECOMMENDED BUT WHEN YOU HAVE A LOCK US ALIVE A 
ocancer10220059 IT'S LIKE A FUNCTION OF A MOUSE ALL IT IS ACTUALLY BAD FOR YOUR TEETH AND THAT FOR MOUSE HIGH TEENS OF HANDLING FOUR TIMES YOU'RE MAKING SURE TO INCUR PROPERLY 
ocancer10220060 AFTER EVERY TIME I EAT ANY FOOD ALWAYS A WATER PICK I WERE OTHER TYPE OF A PRODUCT LIKE THE  THROUGH THEM ACTUALLY ONE FOR TRAVEL 
ocancer10220061 ONE INDICATION ONE MIGHT BUY BACK TO MY GOD EVERYWHERE I  MARKET CLEAN THE MOUTH OUT I USE A  THREE FOUR TIMES A DAY OF TO KEEP THAT STUFF OUT 
ocancer10220062 MY T. SO IT CAN'T AFFORD CARRIES JUST KNEW HOW TO HOW MUCH TIME THANK YOU CAN'T CLEAN  ANYWAY SO IT'S WORTHWHILE HABITS IN YOUR POCKET A 
ocancer10220063 ANOTHER THING TO THINK ABOUT IS TALKING TO A  START TALKING TO SOME BE A HEALTHY START GOING TO QUALITY AND NUTRITION TO BE ABLE TO  
ocancer10220064 YOUR BODY AND ABILITY TO HAVE ASKED AGO AND GLASS OF SUCH TO THOSE IN AND YOU'RE IN SUPPORT ON FUNCTION  BONE GROWTH SO YOU WANT TO LOOK AT HAVING 
ocancer10220065 HIGH QUALITY  SOME  IS WELL UNDER SYSTEM YOU HAVE SOMETHING THAT MAY MUSEUM YOU WON'T HAVE OF VITAMINS A. A. C. AND D. ALL

ocancer10220069 I HOPE FOR THOSE OF HAD THE PAST IT HAS THE  ARE PEOPLE WHO ARE FEARFUL FOR FRIENDS AND FAMILY  HAVE WON OR HAVE WON ITS VIDEO K.  AS 
ocancer10220070 IT'S FINE IT'S SO IT'S DESTRUCTIVE BUT THE SAME TIME AS I GAVE MISSING A CHANCE ON LIFE IF I HADN'T HAD THE STONE I WOULD BEEN DEAD AND TWO THOUSAND THIRTEEN AND YOUR
