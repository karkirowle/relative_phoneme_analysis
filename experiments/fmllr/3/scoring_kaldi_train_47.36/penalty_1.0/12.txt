ocancer10210031 LIKE THAT BECAUSE YOU DON'T HAVE THE HEALTHY BACTERIA IN YOUR MOUTH C. HAVE TO KEEP RUSSIAN FALSE AND DOING ALL THAT STUFF THE ORAL CARE INCREASES 
ocancer10210032 I THINK I'M BASICALLY TRYING TO PREVENT THE CANCER FROM COMING BACK SO MY FAVORITE THING TO DO IS TO SELECTIVELY HAVE BEEN ON 
ocancer10210033 THAT'S LIKE A LOT BUT ALSO IN WATCHING EVERYTHING THAT GOES IN MY MOUTH AND I FOUND THIS BOOK IS REALLY HELPFUL 
ocancer10210034 THE GROSSMAN THERAPY ITS NATURAL WAY TO CURE CANCER BUT I'M KIND OF USING IT AS A  EYE PREVENT THE CANCER FROM RECURRING 
ocancer10210035 SOME USING THE COFFEE ANIMALS AND THE  CARE APPLE JUICE IS EVERY DAY I

ocancer10210045  WATER BOTTLE HOLDER SO STAINLESS STEEL THE WAY TO GO AND WITH EVERYTHING HALT AND BANS GET RID OF ALUMINUM 
ocancer10210046 ALUMINUM IS ALSO  SAID TO HAVE THESE LOW I  CRYSTAL STAKE USES PUT ONE IN THIS MATURED 
ocancer10210047 I'VE GOT INTO ORGANIC EYE CARE PRODUCTS AND CLEANERS I THINK EVEN THIS CAN BE AT ONE MONTH OF UNIX 
ocancer10210048 IT'S LIKE A  IN ADDITION TO SWELL ALSO THIS PRODUCT IS THE MOST AMAZING THING ESPECIALLY WHEN HOSPITAL

ocancer10340035 I'VE EVEN LIKE  WITH ME THINKING LIKE WE MAY BE THE FUEL ALL RIGHT AFTERWARDS AND I'M SITTING THERE LANG MAYBE I'LL BE ABLE TO PUT SOME  TOGETHER INTO SOMETHING 
ocancer10340036 LITTLE BIT PRODUCTIVE YEAH LITTLE OR NO THAT WAS NOT HAPPEN I  I REMEMBER BEFORE SURGERY THEY'VE 
ocancer10340037 AGAIN WITH SOME OF THE  WAS SHORTLY BEFORE PULLING OUT I AM ARE PASSING THROUGH THE WHOLE WAYS 
ocancer10340038 ON THE JOURNEY AND THEN COMING IN SURGERY AND NOT LEAVING SEE MUCH APART FROM  WAS DIRECTLY IN FRONT OF ME AND OUT ABOUT WHERE THE TABLE MANNERS

ocancer10340041 MASTER MY FACE OF SUCH OUT I. AS OUT AND I WILL GO UP OF HOURS LATER I. IS EVERYTHING 
ocancer10340042 ING WRINGING A LOT OF PAIN I CONSIDER GIVING OUT OF THE DEAD UNTIL THE NEXT MORNING 
ocancer10340043 WHAT I WALK AWAY WHEN THEY BOUGHT ME UP THROUGH THE NIGHT MAYBE  FROM  JOURNEY TO ACTUAL BED  I  IT WASN'T UNTIL 
ocancer10340044 SOME TIME EIGHTY SEVEN  UP TO THE REST OF THE FIRST TIME I REMEMBER THE STRUGGLE LIGHT ACTUALLY GETTING UP AND GETTING ORDER 
ocancer10340045 STROM AND  MYSELF  GIVES A SHOT AND HOW DIFFICULT THAT  I GET WOULD NOT EXPECT THAT 
ocancer10340046 ISRAEL AS THEY GET CHANGE THE  SO INITIALLY I THINK WHAT OF THE PAIN 
ocancer10340047 I  WITH NO THAT  WAS YES YOU NINE ON YOUR YOUR GENERAL  SCALE RIGHT I  ACTUALLY DONE WORSE BUT I LEFT JUST BECAUSE OF THE  
ocancer10340048 AN IN THE DRUG LOAD YEAH I HAD TO THE J. P. I. DRAIN RIGHT SO FOR THE  SECTION PORTION 
ocancer10340049 PUT A  TRAIN WITH OF THE TWO  HERE I UNAWARE THAT MY NECK THE NEXT FIVE OR SIX DAYS SMUGGLING 
ocancer10340050   TWICE A DAY OR SO MAY CONCLUDE THAT CAME OUT I. AFTER A FEW DAYS TO THE FOOD IS A CLEAR ENOUGH AND THE VOLUME AND REDUCE ENOUGH 
ocancer10340051  IT OUT SOME MEMBER GETTING CAUGHT A MOM TRIM BACK UP HOPKINS BALTIMORE AND I MEETING WITH THE 
ocancer10340052 NURSE EYE ON HAND HIS CONVICTION REMOVING IT WAS A MAJOR THINGS AGO WHEN TOUTING THE STOCK IT WAS A NOTICE OF A MILD YOU KNOW IT 
ocancer10340053 BRIEF AND UNEXPECTED SENSATION AS I CAME OUT AND I WAS AMAZING FIT SUCH A LARGE THE VALVE IN SUCH A SMALL HOLE 
ocancer10340054 BY THIS NEW TWO WEEK MARKED THE PAIN HAD GONE DOWN SIGNIFICANTLY SAID THAT THAT WAS FINE WITHIN SEVERAL DAYS BUT 
ocancer10340055 THE ENERGY LEVELS AND THE ABILITY TO BE LIKE A WEEK YOU KNOW FOR MORE THAN TWELVE HOURS A DAY JUST THAT TOOK SEVERAL WEEKS RECOVER IT WAS  DAMAGE 
ocancer10340056 BOTH WITH I  TO ME REDUCING ABILITY EAT ACTUALLY GET THE NEW TREATY TO RECOVER AND ALSO THE SIZE OF 
ocancer10340057 THE INCEPTION OF THE  ACTION JUST WHAT YOU WILL GET BETTER 
ocancer10340058 THIS TIME I  NATION NOW I REMEMBER BEING TENTATIVE SET AFTER SURGERY AND LIKE YOU GO IN UNLIKE THE SEOUL 
ocancer10340059 TO ME AND HIM TO COME OUT I FELT SO MUCH WORSE THAN WHEN I WENT I. BECAUSE THEY KNOW THE TUMOR DOESN'T ACTUALLY DO ANYTHING TO YOU JUST AS  
ocancer10340060 WHILE THE COMPANY DOESN'T GIVE THEM IMPACT UNTIL ITS PAST SIZE AND GONE IS BRINGING ON EVERY CRITICAL STUDENT BODY RIGHT  
ocancer10340061 IT BEFORE AND I FELT I ACTUALLY FINE AND AFTER IT WAS JUST COULDN'T DO ANYTHING FOR FOUR WEEKS ON IT BUT THAT DID IMPROVE SLOWLY 
ocancer10340062 BUT I DROPPED ABOUT WHAT TEN OR TWELVE POUNDS IN THE FIRST WEEK ASKED LEAST AFTER ABOUT A DAY OR SO AS OF THE DRINK SOME 
ocancer10340063 SOME COOL ROTH AN  HIGH TEMPERATURE WOULD BE AN AWFUL RIGHT AT LEAST THAT HOLDER THAT  THAT WORKED BUY 
ocancer10340064 B. D. FOUR HAS INDICTED APPLE SAUCE  ROTH AND THEN BY A DAY SEVEN HOURS ON A DIET OF APPLE SAUCE  ROTH AND  
ocancer10340065 YEAH I WAS MAYBE AFTER ABOUT TWO OR THREE WEEKS I COULD HAVE ON SOME SOFTER FOODS 
ocancer10340066 THE BAKED BEANS SALMON I VERY VERY TENDER CHICKEN YEAH NO DIFFICULTY WITH TASTE BUT MY 
ocancer10340067 TUNG WAS VERY NOT THE FIRST FEW WEEKS I EVEN TODAY DOES FEEL STRANGE AND EVERY TIME I SPEAK I CAN STILL TELL THAT THERE IS A VERY  
ocancer10340068 LEAR AND DOWNS FROM THE LEFT AND RIGHT SIDE BY ROUTINELY  TUNG I CAN'T HAVE A LITTLE BIT LESS KNOWLEDGE FOR WHERE IT IS MY MOUTH 
ocancer10340069 IN A SURPRISING TO BUY THAT SO OFTEN BECAUSE THERE'S LESS THAT THEIR TO BITE I. BUT YEAH 
ocancer10340070 I  HOPKINS TO SPEAK TO FALL JUST FOR A COUPLE OF MEETINGS AND TO GIVE ME SOME EXERCISES UNTIL THE  ABILITY USUALLY BECAUSE OF THE 
ocancer10340071 RATHER SMALL AREA THAT WAS REJECTED THE IDEA OF MANY LONG TERM IMPACT HAS BEEN SHRINKING I CAN UNSEAT ABOUT AS GOOD AS EAST 
ocancer10340072 I  CAN TELL THE DIFFERENCE RIGHT EYE BUT THAT C. I. I.  ALSO SEEN A FISCAL THEIR BEST THERE'S A WHOLE 
ocancer10340073  HAD TO DO THEIR MOSTLY TO REGAIN THE NECK ABILITY AND THE  
ocancer10340074 I'M NOT SURE YOUR VIEW PERFECTLY NORMAL AGAIN FROM THOSE THINGS WAS LIKE THIS IS A RATHER LARGE AN UNEXPECTED CHANGE 
ocancer10340075 THEN IT  FROM THERE ON RIGHT THIS THE THINGS YOU VALUE AND WHAT YOU CARE ABOUT
