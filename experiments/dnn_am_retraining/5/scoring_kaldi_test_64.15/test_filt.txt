10210001 HI EVERYONE I'M JUST HERE TO GIVE YOU MY ONE-YEAR FINDING OUT ABOUT MY TONGUE CANCER UPDATE 
10210002 UM JUST TO LET YOU KNOW WHAT I HAD I HAD TONGUE CANCER THEY CUT IT OUT 
10210003 THERE I CUT MY NECK HERE TO THE BACK AND THEY REMOVED THE LYMPH NODES I TESTED THEM ONE OF THEM THEY SAW METASTASES 
10210004 SO THEY WENT AHEAD AND REMOVED THE OTHER ONES NEXT LEVEL I THINK THE CUTS HERE AND THEY ALSO OPENED THIS AGAIN 
10210005 AND REMOVED THE BOTTOM ONES THERE SO BASICALLY THIS WAS THE FIRST SURGERY IN MY TONGUE AND HERE NO SECOND ONE WAS HERE AGAIN 
10210006 AND DOWN HERE THEN AFTER THAT ABOUT A MONTH LATER I HAD THE CHEMOTHERAPY START WITH CISPLATIN 
10210007 AND THEN THIRTY FIVE SESSIONS MONDAY THROUGH FRIDAY OF THE RADIATION WHICH THEY GOT ME BASICALLY IN THIS 
10210008 AREA I DIDN'T LOSE MY HAIR FROM THE CHEMOTHERAPY BECAUSE AFTER THE FIRST ONE FOR THE FIRST CISPLATIN AND I GOT 
10210009 AFTER THE SECOND ONE SORRY I GOT A LITTLE BIT SICK I THINK IT WAS JUST TOO MUCH MEDICINE IN MY BODY SO THEY WENT AHEAD AND GAVE ME LIKE AN 
10210010 ANTIBODY FOR THE THIRD CHEMOTHERAPY SO I DIDN'T LOSE MY HAIR OR ANYTHING BUT THE CHEMOTHERAPY WASN'T A BIG DEAL BUT THE RADIATION 
10210011 THAT ACTUALLY LOST MY HAIR KIND OF ON A BACK HERE IT'S GROWING BACK NOW A YEAR LATER MAYBE TWO INCHES LONG SO 
10210012 JUST DOWN HERE THIS WHOLE BOTTOM SECTION SLOWLY FELL OUT AS YOU CAN MAYBE HEAR I CAN'T SAY MY SS IS 
10210013 VERY WELL IT KIND OF SOUNDS LIKE AN AS H. AND I HAVE DRY MOUTH SO I CARRY WATER WITH ME 
10210014 EVERYWHERE AND ALSO AND LET'S SEE I CAN'T TASTE FOOD AS MUCH I CAN IT'S COMING BACK SLOWLY BUT IT'S DEFINITELY 
10210015 NOT HUNDRED PERCENT AND I THINK I DON'T THINK IT WILL COME BACK HUNDRED PERCENT BUT WHO KNOWS IT'S ONLY A YEAR OUT WATER TASTES A LITTLE BIT 
10210016 STRANGE TO ME NOW I CAN'T REALLY HAVE A LOT OF VINEGAR ACIDIC FOOD I THINK YOU HAVE PHRASE SYNDROME NOW WHERE 
10210017 BECAUSE I LOST SOME OF THE SALIVARY GLANDS THE RADIATION PRETTY MUCH KILLS ABOUT FORTY PERCENT SO NOW 
10210018 SINCE I DON'T REALLY SALIVATE THAT MUCH I THINK THE NERVES THAT WERE KILLED END UP GOING INTO LIKE YOUR SKIN ON THE SURFACE OF YOUR FACE SO IF I 
10210019 HAVE SOMETHING THAT'S ACIDIC OR SALTY OR SPICY WHICH I CAN'T HAVE TOO MUCH SPICY STUFF LIKE YEAH I USED TO IT 
10210020 BECAUSE THIS IS TOO MUCH PAIN BUT I'LL START TO SWEAT HERE AND ABOVE MY BROW LIKE KETCHUP YEAH IT'S REALLY PAINFUL 
10210021 ANYWAY SEE WHAT ELSE OTHER WAYS IT AFFECTED MY LIFE AND SPEECH SAYING THAT MORE CONSCIOUS ABOUT MY SPEECH SOME PEOPLE SAY 
10210022 THEY DON'T NOTICE IT BUT I NOTICE EVERY TIME I SAY AN S. WORD SOMETIMES MY VOICE CHANGES I THINK MY VOICE 
10210023 IS A LITTLE BIT DEEPER NOW AND SO AND SOMETIMES EVEN IN AFTERNOON IT SOUNDS LIKE I HAVE MORNING VOICE 
10210024 WHAT ELSE I DON'T KNOW HERE MY NECK SINCE I CUT HERE AND THE RADIATION THIS MUSCLE HERE IS 
10210025 AS YOU CAN SEE IT'S KIND OF STICKING OUT IS REALLY TIGHT AND SO I CAN LEAN MY HEAD ABOUT THIS FAR BUT ON THE OTHER SIDE I CAN GO 
10210026 A LOT FURTHER I CAN'T REALLY TURN MY HEAD A LOT BEFORE I FEEL IT START TO PULL BUT DOESN'T REALLY HURT THAT MUCH 
10210027 AND YEAH AND THEN JUST THAT JUST THE TONGUE THE VOLUME IS LESS OVER HERE 
10210028 AND THEN THE RADIATION ALSO MESSES UP YOUR GUMS SO MY TEETH LIKE THE ROOT OF MY TEETH ON BOTH THE TOP AND THE BOTTOM 
10210029 ARE PAINFUL LIKE IF I DRINK SOMETHING THAT'S NOT WRONG A LITTLE BIT WARM AND I CAN FEEL THE PAIN IN MY GUMS AND 
10210030 DOWN ON MY TEETH LIKE ON THE BOTTOM THERE IT'S A LITTLE BIT MORE EXPOSED AND THEN YOU HAVE ALL KINDS OF FUN ENAMEL PROBLEMS AND THINGS 
10210031 LIKE THAT BECAUSE YOU DON'T HAVE THE HEALTHY BACTERIA IN YOUR MOUTH SO YOU HAVE TO KEEP BRUSHING AND FLOSSING AND DOING ALL THAT STUFF THE ORAL CARE INCREASES 
10210032 NEXT THING I'M BASICALLY TRYING TO PREVENT THE CANCER FROM COMING BACK SO MY FAVORITE THING TO DO IS PHYSICAL ACTIVITY I'VE BEEN ON 
10210033 MY BIKE A LOT BUT ALSO I'M WATCHING EVERYTHING THAT GOES IN MY MOUTH AND I FOUND THIS BOOK IS REALLY HELPFUL 
10210034 THIS IS THE GERSON THERAPY IT'S A NATURAL WAY TO CURE CANCER BUT I'M KIND OF USING IT AS A PREVENT THE CANCER FROM RECURRING 
10210035 SO I'M USING THE COFFEE ENAMELS AND THE CARROT APPLE JUICES EVERY DAY AND MAKES ME FEEL PRETTY 
10210036 HEALTHY I'M ALSO IN A PLACE WHERE I HAVE ACCESS TO ISCADOR IT'S ALSO CALLED MISSILE ISCADOR 
10210037 IT'S ALSO CALLED MISTLETOE THERAPY IT'S BASICALLY IT'S MADE BY THE COMPANY WELEDA OR LOOKS LIKE WELEDA 
10210038 BUT IT'S GERMAN THESE ARE THE LOW BACK PILLS AND I OPEN THEM UP AND PUT 
10210039 THOSE INJECT THEM INTO MY BODY MONDAY THROUGH FRIDAY THREE TIMES A WEEK AND AND THAT'S SUPPOSED TO 
10210040 PREVENT THE CANCER FROM COMING BACK AS WELL AS WE HAVE A PART OF THE TREATMENT IS EVERY TWO WEEKS I TAKE A HIGH DOSE OF VITAMIN D BECAUSE EVEN THOUGH I'M IN THE SUNSHINE ALL THE TIME 
10210041 AND I RIDE MY BIKE AND EVERYTHING AND IT'S STILL NOT ENOUGH I GUESS BECAUSE THE UV OR THE EVERYTHING IN ATMOSPHERE IS PREVENTING US FROM REALLY 
10210042 GETTING THAT VITAMIN SO I TAKE IT SO I TAKE A SUPPLEMENT AND THEN I JUST TRIED TO ELIMINATE LIKE I'M ON THE BIKE ALL THE TIME I THINK I WAS DRINKING A LOT FROM 
10210043 PLASTIC BOTTLES AND WE KNOW THE PLASTIC ISN'T GOOD SO I HAVE SINCE SWITCHED OVER I DROPPED THE MONEY AND PAID FOR THE KLEAN KANTEEN 
10210044 STAINLESS STEEL BOTTLE COMES THE CAP OR YOU CAN GET ONE WITHOUT THIS PIECE IT JUST SCREWS ON AND IT 
10210045 FITS INTO MY WATER BOTTLE HOLDER SO STAINLESS STEEL THE WAY TO GO AND WITH EVERYTHING POTS AND PANS GET RID OF ALUMINUM 
10210046 ALUMINUM IS ALSO IN YOUR DEODORANT SO THEY HAVE THESE LITTLE IT'S LIKE A CRYSTAL STICK YOU JUST PUT WATER ON IT AND THIS IS MY DEODORANT 
10210047 I'VE GONE TO ORGANIC HAIR PRODUCTS AND CLEANERS I THINK THEY EVEN THIS CAN BE AT WALMART ORGANICS 
10210048 IT'S JUST LIKE A GEL BUT I HAVE THE SHAMPOO AS WELL ALSO THIS PRODUCT IS THE MOST AMAZING THING ESPECIALLY WHEN YOU'RE IN HOSPITAL AND YOU DON'T GET THE 
10210049 SHOWER EVERY DAY IT IS THE DR. BRONNER'S MAGIC SOAP IT IS AWESOME THIS IS WHAT I USED TO WASH MY HANDS NOW WASH MY FACE UM 
10210050 SINCE I HAVE THE CANCER UP HERE I'M TRYING TO GET RID OF ALL THE PARAFFINS AND ALL THE CHEMICALS AND THINGS THAT I PUT ON MY HEAD ON MY FACE AND 
10210051 I MEAN I DON'T EVEN LIKE TO USE LOTION ANYMORE BECAUSE ALL THAT STUFF IS GOING INTO YOUR SKIN SO I ADVISE THE PEPPER MERC SMELLS GOOD 
10210052 AND WHAT ELSE PROBABLY THAT'S MOSTLY IT I'M JUST TRYING TO 
10210053 WRAP MY HEAD AROUND ALL THIS IT'S COMING UP ON A YEAR AND I HAVE A PET C. T. SCAN IN A FEW WEEKS I WAS ACTUALLY GOING TO WAIT FOR MY ONE-YEAR ANNIVERSARY 
10210054 ON HALLOWEEN TO MAKE THIS VIDEO BUT I COULDN'T MAKE ANY LONGER I REALLY WANTED TO COMMUNICATE THIS WITH THE COMMUNITY OUT THERE WHO ARE YOUNG 
10210055 I'M ONLY THIRTY ONE NOW I WAS DIAGNOSED WHEN I WAS THIRTY AND YOU KNOW IT WAS ONLY A MONTH LATER THAT 
10210056 I WENT AHEAD AND HAD THE SURGERY SO THE KEY THING IS WHEN YOU SEE SOMETHING FUNNY ON YOUR TONGUE IT HURTS JUST LIKE A TYPICAL ULCER 
10210057 AFTER TWO WEEKS YOU NEED TO GO GET IT CHECKED OUT AND A LOT OF DENTISTS DON'T EVEN KNOW WE WON'T KNOW WHAT IT IS THEY'LL JUST SAY IT'S A SORE THEY'LL GIVE YOU A CREAM 
10210058 HAVE THEM DO THE BIOPSY IF IT'S BEEN MORE THAN TWO WEEKS BECAUSE A LOT OF TIMES THEY'LL FIND THAT IT'S CANCEROUS IF IT'S IF IT'S STARTING TO GROW I MEAN MINE WAS ABOUT MMM 
10210059 LIKE THIS ON THE BASE OF MY TONGUE ABOUT ONE AND A HALF CENTIMETERS LONG BY ABOUT ONE CENTIMETER HIGH AND I'M NOT SURE HOW DEEP IT WENT IN BUT 
10210060 THEY THINK THAT DIDN'T REALLY SPREAD JUST TILL THAT ONE LYMPH NODE BUT WHEN THEY FIND IT IN ONE THEY TAKE ALL OF THEM OUT BECAUSE THEY WANT TO BE 
10210061 SAFE AND THEN THEY JUST GIVE ME ALL THE THE HIGHEST LEVEL I GUESS OF RADIATION THAT WOULD KILL ANYTHING ELSE THAT 
10210062 WAS POSSIBLY IN THERE BUT NOW I'M TRYING TO YOU KNOW USE SOME OF THESE ALTERNATIVE METHODS AND PREVENT IT FROM REOCCURRING AND YEAH 
10210063 I THINK THAT'S ALL I HAVE FOR NOW IF YOU HAVE ANY QUESTIONS FEEL FREE TO POST THEM I'LL PROBABLY I'LL PROBABLY PUT SOME LINKS WHERE YOU CAN FIND SOME OF THE PRODUCTS IF YOU'RE NOT SURE AND MOST OF THESE PRODUCTS 
10210064 YOU CAN ALMOST ALL OF THEM YOU CAN GET IN THE UNITED STATES AND SOME OF THEM I HAD MY FAMILY SEND I'M OUT OF THE COUNTRY NOW SO I HAD THEM SEND 
10210065 THEM TO ME I'VE ALSO HAD ONE THING DURING THE RADIATION I HAD A LOT OF PAIN I HAD MUCOSIS AND MY 
10210066 MOUTH WAS COMPLETELY DRY AND I COULDN'T EVEN DRINK WATER I HAD HAD TO GET A FEEDING TUBE MY MOUTH HAD CUTS AND SORES EVERYTHING ALL OVER 
10210067 I DID USE A PRODUCT CALLED DUVAN IT'S JUVEN GO JUVEN DOT COM IT'S SUPPOSED TO HELP 
10210068 YOUR SKIN HEAL QUICKER ESPECIALLY IF YOU HAVE SCARS AND THINGS LIKE THAT SOME PEOPLE DON'T EVEN NOTICE MY SCAR BECAUSE IT'S KIND OF IN THE FOLD OF THE NECK BUT UM 
10210069 BUT I THINK IT ALSO HELPS WITH THE TONGUE SO I FEEL LIKE THAT WAS A REALLY GOOD PRODUCT THAT I USED DURING CHEMO THE RADIATION ALL OF THAT SO THE SOONER YOU 
10210070 CAN GET THAT THE BETTER AND DO IT FOR AS LONG AS YOU CAN AFFORD IT CUZ IT'S NOT CHEAP BUT I THINK IT'S REALLY WORTH IT DOING LET'S JUST GET THE NON-FLAVORED 
10210071 POWDER MIX IT IN WITH YOUR DRINK AND TWO TIMES A DAY AND I THINK IT REALLY HELPED MY TONGUE TO HEAL 
10210072 AND THEN THE MORPHINE LIKE I SAID THE MORPHINE TO HELP I WAS IN THE HOUSE WAS ALSO UM YEAH I WAS LOOKING FOR SOME AMERICAN MEDICAL MARIJUANA 
10210073 HERE WHEN I'M AT BUT I COULDN'T REALLY GET IT BECAUSE I'M IN A DIFFERENT COUNTRY BUT I I WOULD I WAS AT THE POINT WHERE I WAS CONSIDERING DOING THAT BECAUSE I 
10210074 WAS IN SO MUCH PAIN BUT YEAH I GUESS THAT'S ALL I HAVE FOR NOW IF YOU HAVE ANY QUESTIONS UHM FEEL FREE 
10210075 TO ASK ME AND YEAH ALL I CAN SAY IS GOOD LUCK AND SAY YOUR PRAYERS BECAUSE IT'S A TOUGH PROCESS BUT YOU CAN GET THROUGH IT 
10210076 HERE I AM A YEAR LATER AND UHM YEAH STILL EATING STILL ALIVE STILL GOING WE WILL SEE HOW THE SCAN GOES IN 
10210077 IN A WEEK OR TWO BUT GOOD LUCK STAY STRONG AND WELL MAYBE I'LL DO A TWO YEAR UPDATE WILL SEE ALRIGHT SEE YA 
10340001 I WAS DIAGNOSED WITH 
10340002 SQUAMOUS CELL CARCINOMA MY LEFT ANTERIOR TONGUE BACK IN MARCH TWO THOUSAND SIXTEEN ROUGHLY TWO YEARS AGO AT THE AGE OF TWENTY SIX I JUST KIND OF NOTICED 
10340003 A SMALL BUMP ON MY TONGUE ONE MORNING EARLY IN JANUARY AFTER THE NEW YEAR AND I WAS LIKE WELL THAT'S VERY STRANGE FOR LIKE A CANKER SORE OR SOMETHING A LITTLE BIT ON THE LARGE SIDE 
10340004 AND I KIND OF WAITED FOR IT TO GO AWAY AND IT DIDN'T THEN BY I GUESS LATE IN JANUARY NEAR THE END OF THE MONTH I'D WENT TO SEE MY DOCTOR WHO REFERRED ME TO AN ENT 
10340005 THE ENT SPOKE WITH ME AND SAID YOU KNOW THAT'S VERY STRANGE AND ASKED TO DO SOME TESTS TOOK A SWAB OF IT
10340006 IT SAID THIS MIGHT BE SOME SORT OF LIKE INFECTION SO HE GAVE ME I THINK THE MOCK CASILLA AND ANOTHER CREAM TO PUT ON IT THAT WOULD HELP
10340007 TAKE CARE OF ANY INFECTION THAT DIDN'T PROVE TO MAKE IT GO AWAY SO THEN HE SAID MAYBE IT'S AN ABRASION RIGHT AND GAVE ME SOME WAX PUT IN MY TEETH 
10340008 THAT AREA ABRASIONS THE TONGUE AFTER ANOTHER TWO WEEKS THAT DIDN'T GO AWAY AND HE'S LIKE WELL THERE'S NO WAY THIS COULD BE CANCER BECAUSE YOU'RE TWENTY SIX YOU'RE A
10340009 NONSMOKER YOU BARELY DRINK AND YOU EVEN HEARD GET HER CELL BUT LET'S DO BIOPSY NO WAY TO FIND OUT WHAT IT IS SO WE DID THAT AND A WEEK LATER I GOT THE PHONE CALL ON MY WAY
10340010 INTO WORK WHERE HE ASKED ME IF I COME IN THE OFFICE TODAY JUST BECAUSE I'M ABOUT THE ABOUT THE DIAGNOSE
10340011 OF THE DIAGNOSIS AND I SAID NO EYES WAITING FOR YOUR PHONE CALL AND THEY WILL HOW ARE YOU DOING WELL YOU TELL ME RIGHT AND HE BEGINS SAYING WELL 
10340012 IT APPEARS THAT YOU HAVE ONE OF A TYPES OF CANCER
10340013 AND THAT WAS HOW I FOUND OUT I REMEMBER IT'S GETTING INCREASINGLY WORRIED OVER TIME RIGHT YOU'D HOPE TO BE 
10340014 SOMETHING SMALL THAT THE DOCTOR COULD SEE AND THEN IMMEDIATELY GO THAT'S JUST YOU KNOW IT JUST IS AN ABRASION PUT SOME WAX IN IT WILL GO AWAY RIGHT AND AS TIME PASSED AND EACH
10340015 PROGRESSIVE TREATMENT DIDN'T TAKE CARE OF THE ISSUE AND IT BECAME MORE CLEAR THAT THIS MIGHT ACTUALLY BE A TUMOR JUST THE
10340016 WORRY AND THE FEAR KIND OF BUILT UP UNTIL YOU FIND IT ACTUALLY IS AND THEN THERE'S YOU KNOW THERE'S NO MORE FEAR ABOUT THE WHAT IFS FEAR ABOUT WHAT WHAT IS
10340017 PRIOR TO THE DIAGNOSIS I'D KEPT IT MOST OF MYSELF I MEAN FOR MY BOSS BEFORE THE BIOPSY THAT'D BE OUT FOR A DAY OR TWO JUST BECAUSE THESE THINGS AWAY YOU KNOW 
10340018 PART OF THE TONGUE IT MADE IT A LITTLE BIT PAINFUL TO SPEAK FOR THE NEXT DAY IT DIDN'T WANT TO ACTUALLY COME INTO THE OFFICE RIGHT AND THEN OTHER PEOPLE WOULD KNOW THEY'D NOTICE NOT REMEMBER AS MY
10340019 PHONE CALLED MY BROTHER I GUESS THE WEEK BEFORE THE BIOPSY JUST TALKING ABOUT WHATEVER GENERAL LIKE HOW ARE YOU DOING YOU KNOW OH I SAID A YOU KNOW PR 
10340020 THE DEADLIFT IN THE GYM THIS WEEK THEY'RE LIKE OH I WENT ON A DATE WHATEVER I FORGET WHAT WE'VE EVEN TALKED ABOUT AT THE END I WAS JUST LIKE BY THE WAY JUST RANDOM THIN 
10340021 I ACTUALLY SAW A BUMP ON MY TONGUE ABOUT A MONTH AND A HALF AGO IT HASN'T GONE AWAY SO I'M GONNA HAVE A BIOPSY LATER ON THIS WEEK JUST WISH ME LUCK YOU KNOW COULD BE CANCER 
10340022 I DON'T THINK IT IS JUST GIVEN HOW HEALTHY I AM BUT IT MIGHT BE AND HIS REACTION WAS THAT LIKE OH WELL THERE'S NO WAY IT COULD BE BECAUSE IF YOU HAVE CANCER THEN THE REST OF US WE'RE ALL WE'RE ALL SCREWED
10340023 RIGHT BECAUSE YOU KNOW APART FROM THIS ONE DIAGNOSIS I'M A VERY HEALTHY INDIVIDUAL RIGHT NOT DRINKING NOT SMOKING LIGHTLY DRINKING NOT SMOKING 
10340024 EVEN ON THE WHOLE I EAT ORGANIC AND EVERYTHING TRAIN RIGHT BUT HE'S JUST LIKE YEAH THERE'S NO WAY THEN YEAH
10340025 IT'S THE RIGHT TO BE SCARED IT MAKES SENSE IT'S NATURAL JUST GO WITH IT TRUST YOUR DOCTORS
10340026 IT'S THE BEST YOU CAN DO RIGHT I DID FIND IT KIND OF INTERESTING THAT AS I APPROACH SURGERY I ACTUALLY BECAME LESS
10340027 AND LESS SCARED AS I KIND OF BEGAN TO ACCEPT THAT THIS IS THE WAY THINGS ARE I AM SEEING VERY GOOD DOCTOR THERE'S
10340028 NOTHING I CAN DO TO CHANGE SITUATIONS SO I JUST NEED TO RELAX AND LET THE DOCTORS DO THEIR WORK BECAUSE IF YOU YOU KNOW YOU DON'T HAVE ENOUGH 
10340029 EMOTIONAL ENERGY TO EVEN WORRY ABOUT IT AND STRESS ABOUT IT JUST NOT SOMETHING YOU CAN EVEN MANAGE I WAS
10340030 FORTUNATE ENOUGH TO ONLY NEED A SINGLE SURGERY SO I HAD A PARTIAL GLOSSECTOMY REMOVING ABOUT A FIFTH OF THE FORM AS PART OF MY TONGUE 
10340031 AND THEN I HAD A SLIGHT NECK DISSECTION ON THE LEFT SIDE TO REMOVE THE LYMPH NODES WELL THIS WAS ACTUALLY MY FIRST TIME HAVING SURGERY IT WAS A 
10340032 BRAND NEW EXPERIENCE TO ME YEAH VERY SIGNIFICANT ONE FOR FOR A FIRST-TIMER RIGHT NEED HOPE YOU GET LIKE YOUR TONSILS OUT WHEN YOU'RE A KID AND KIND OF LIKE A WARM UP ROUND BUT 
10340033 NO IT WAS ALL DONE IN A SINGLE PROCEDURE LAST COUPLE HOURS I WAS IN AND OUT I THINK 23 AND A HALF HOURS YEAH I JUST REMEMBER 
10340034 I FELT VERY CALM BEFOREHAND GOING IN DIDN'T REALLY KNOW WHAT TO EXPECT MY PARENTS ARE WITH ME WHICH WAS A GREAT RELIEF GREAT HELP 
10340035 I'VE EVEN LIKE BROUGHT A BOOK WITH ME THINKING LIKE WELL MAYBE IF I FEEL ALL RIGHT AFTERWARDS AND I'M SITTING THERE LAYING MAYBE I'LL BE ABLE TO PUT SOME COHERENT THOUGHTS TOGETHER AND DO SOMETHING
10340036 A LITTLE BIT PRODUCTIVE YEAH LITTLE I KNOW THAT WAS NOT GONNA HAPPEN NO I REMEMBER BEFORE SURGERY THEY 
10340037 BEGAN WITH SOME OF THE ANESTHESIA I FORGET WHAT IT WAS SHORTLY BEFORE ROLLING ME OUT I REMEMBER PASSING THROUGH THE HALLWAYS
10340038 ON THE GURNEY AND THEN COMING INTO THE SURGERY ROOM NOT REALLY BEING THE SCENE MUCH APART FROM YOU KNOW WHAT'S DIRECTLY IN FRONT OF ME AND THEY BROUGHT ME WITH THE TABLE I REMEMBER THERE WAS LIKE A PINK
10340039 PILLOW ON ON THE TABLE SOME ROUND PILLOW AND THEY SAID ALL RIGHT NOW GET YOURSELF UP ON THE TABLE AND I WAS ALREADY VERY WOOZY BUT THIS POINT AND I WAS LIKE I KNOW A BIGGER GUY
10340040 YOU KNOW BUT LIKE THERE'S FOUR IF YOU HEAR LIKE CAN YOU HELP ME OUT LIKE JUST THINKING AND THEN IT'S LIKE I PUT YOUR HEAD IN THE PILLOW AND NOW WE'RE GONNA BEGIN BUT AS SOON AS THAT WE'RE GONNA BEGIN AND PUT THE
10340041 MASK OVER MY FACE I WAS JUST OUT EYES OUT AND THEN I WOKE UP A COUPLE HOURS LATER JUST EVERYTHING
10340042 RINGING A LOT OF PAIN DON'T THINK I'VE EVEN GOT OUT OF THE BED UNTIL THE NEXT MORNING 
10340043 I WAS WELL I WOKE UP IN THE WAITING ROOM AND THEY BROUGHT ME UP TO THE ROOM FOR THE NIGHT MAYBE I GUESS THEY'D SHIPPED ME FROM THE GURNEY TO AN ACTUAL BED I DON'T REMEMBER THAT PART EVEN AND IT WASN'T UNTIL
10340044 SOMETIME MAYBE SEVEN O'CLOCK IN THE MORNING WERE ACTUALLY GOT UP TO USE THE RESTROOM FOR THE FIRST TIME I REMEMBER THE STRUGGLE LIKE ACTUALLY GETTING UP AND GETTING OVER TO THE 
10340045 RESTROOM AND YOU KNOW BE LIKE I'LL HANDLE IT MYSELF LIKE LET ME GIVE THIS A SHOT AND HOW DIFFICULT THAT WAS YEAH WE DID NOT EXPECT THAT 
10340046 HE WAS VARIABLE AS THEY YOU KNOW CHANGED THE THE DRUGS I WAS RECEIVING IN THE IV SO INITIALLY I WAS IN QUITE A BIT OF PAIN
10340047 I LET THEM KNOW THAT YOU KNOW IT WAS YES EIGHT OR NINE ON YOUR YOU KNOW YOUR GENERAL OUT OF TEN SCALE RIGHT I THINK THE PAIN HAD ACTUALLY GOTTEN WORSE BY THE TIME I LEFT JUST BECAUSE OF THE REDUCTION
10340048 IN THE DRUG LOAD YEAH I HAD THE JP DRAIN RIGHT SO FOR THE NEXT SECTION PORTION THEY 
10340049 PUT A JP DRAIN WITH THE THE TUBE COMING UP TO HERE AND THEN I WORE THAT AROUND MY NECK THE NEXT FIVE OR SIX DAYS WAS MY BLING RIGHT
10340050 GETTING TO EMPTY IT I GUESS TWICE A DAY OR SO MEASURING THE FLUID THAT CAME OUT AND AFTER A FEW DAYS THE FLUID WAS A CLEAR ENOUGH AND THE VOLUME HAD REDUCED ENOUGH
10340051 THAT I WAS ABLE TO GET IT OUT SO I REMEMBER GETTING IN THE CAR WITH MY MOM DRIVING BACK UP TO HOPKINS BALTIMORE AND MEETING WITH THE 
10340052 NURSE ON HAND WHO'S GONNA BE ACTUALLY REMOVING IT IT'S WASN'T A MAJOR THING IT'S JUST YOU KNOW ONE TUGGING IS DONE IT WAS A YOU KNOW THAT WAS A MILD YOU KNOW
10340053 A BRIEF AND UNEXPECTED SENSATION AS I CAME OUT AND I WAS AMAZED TO EVEN FIT SUCH A LARGE VALVE IN SUCH A SMALL HOLE 
10340054 BY I GUESS MAYBE THE TWO WEEK MARK THE PAIN HAD GONE DOWN SIGNIFICANTLY SO THAT THAT WAS FINE WITHIN SEVERAL DAYS BUT JUST
10340055 THE ENERGY LEVELS AND THE ABILITY TO BE LIKE AWAKE YOU KNOW FOR MORE THAN TWELVE HOURS A DAY JUST THAT TOOK SEVERAL WEEKS TO RECOVER AND IT WAS QUITE A LOT OF DAMAGE
10340056 BOTH WITH GOT SICK TO ME REDUCING YOUR ABILITY TO EAT AND ACTUALLY GET THE NUTRIENTS YOU NEED TO RECOVER THEN ALSO JUST THE SIZE OF
10340057 THE INCISION THE NECK DISSECTION JUST TOOK A WHILE YOU WILL GET BETTER
10340058 THIS TAKES TIME BE PATIENT YOU KNOW I REMEMBER BEING KIND OF UPSET AFTER SURGERY AND THEY'RE LIKE YOU GO IN YOU'RE LIKE THIS WILL
10340059 CURE ME AND THEN WHEN YOU COME OUT I FELT SO MUCH WORSE THAN WHEN I WENT IN RIGHT BECAUSE YOU KNOW THE TUMOR IT DOESN'T ACTUALLY DO ANYTHING TO YOU JUST AS A
10340060 LITTLE LUMP ON YOUR TONGUE IT DOESN'T DOESN'T HAVE ANY IMPACT UNTIL IT'S METASTASIZED AND GONE AND IT'S BRINGING DOWN EVERY CRITICAL SYSTEM IN YOUR BODY RIGHT I JUST REMEMBER OF 
10340061 BEFOREHAND I FELT YOU KNOW ACTUALLY FINE AND THEN AFTER IT WAS JUST COULDN'T DO ANYTHING FOR FOUR WEEKS ON IT BUT THAT DID IMPROVE SLOWLY 
10340062 OH YEAH I DROPPED ABOUT WHAT TEN OR TWELVE POUNDS IN THE FIRST WEEK AT LEAST AFTER ABOUT A DAY OR SO I WAS ABLE TO DRANK SOME
10340063 SOME COOL BROTH ONCE AGAIN AT HIGH TEMPERATURE WOULD HAVE BEEN AWFUL RIGHT BUT AT LEAST THAT COLDER THAT WAS THAT WORKED BY 
10340064 MAYBE DAY FOUR I WAS IN A DIET OF APPLESAUCE AND BROTH AND THEN BY DAY SEVEN I WAS ON A DIET OF APPLESAUCE BROTH AND MILKSHAKES
10340065 YEAH IT WAS MAYBE AFTER ABOUT TWO OR THREE WEEKS SO THAT I COULD HAVE SOME SOFTER FOODS 
10340066 LOTS OF BAKED BEANS SALMON VERY VERY TENDER COOKED CHICKEN YEAH NO DIFFICULTY WITH TASTE BUT MY 
10340067 TONGUE WAS VERY NUMB FOR THE FIRST FEW WEEKS AND EVEN TODAY IT DOES FEEL STRANGE LIKE EVERY TIME I SPEAK I CAN STILL TELL THAT THERE IS A A VERY
10340068 CLEAR IMBALANCE FROM THE LEFT AND THE RIGHT SIDE RIGHT I ROUTINELY BITE MY TONGUE YEAH I KIND OF HAVE A LITTLE BIT LESS KNOWLEDGE FOR WHERE IT IS IN MY MOUTH 
10340069 AND IT'S SURPRISING TOO THAT I BITE IT SO OFTEN BECAUSE THERE'S LESS OF IT THERE TO BITE BUT YEAH 
10340070 I DID GO BACK TO HOPKINS TO MEET WITH A SPEECH PATHOLOGIST FOR A COUPLE OF MEETINGS AND SHE'D GIVE ME SOME EXERCISES TO HELP WITH TONGUE MOBILITY FORTUNATELY BECAUSE OF THE
10340071 RATHER SMALL AREA THAT WAS RESECTED YOU KNOW I DON'T HAVE MANY LONG-TERM IMPACTS ON SPEECH RIGHT I CAN I CAN ENUNCIATE ABOUT IT AS GOOD AS I USED TO 
10340072 MY MOM STILL TELLS ME SHE CAN TELL THE DIFFERENCE RIGHT BUT THAT'S YOU KNOW YOUR MOM I'VE ALSO SEEN A PHYSICAL THERAPIST THERE'S A WHOLE
10340073 HOST OF EXERCISES AHEAD TO DO THEY'RE MOSTLY TO REGAIN THE NECK MOBILITY AND THE SHOULDER MOBILITY 
10340074 I'M NOT SURE YOU EVER FEEL PERFECTLY NORMAL AGAIN IT'S ONE OF THOSE THINGS SO IT'S LIKE THIS IS A RATHER LARGE AND UNEXPECTED CHANGE 
10340075 AND THEN IT IT CHANGES YOUR OUTLOOK FROM THERE ON RIGHT JUST THE THINGS YOU VALUE AND WHAT YOU CARE ABOUT
10340076 AND WHAT YOU PRETTY NO LONGER TOLERATE AND THE KINDS OF NONSENSE YOU WON'T WASTE YOUR TIME ON ONCE YOU'VE COME SO CLOSE TO
10340077 LOSING EVERYTHING YEAH SO KIND OF PSYCHOLOGICALLY EMOTIONALLY PERSONALLY I'M NOT SURE THAT YOU EVER GET BACK TO WHAT WAS NORMAL
10340078 BUT PRETTY SOON YOU KIND OF FEEL LIKE THIS IS WHO I AM NOW AND YOU BECOME OKAY WITH THAT PHYSICALLY
10340079 IT WAS A FEW MONTHS I STILL HAVE PLENTY OF REHAB TO DO AFTER SURGERY A ABSOLUTELY CRITICAL YEAH I WOULD NOT 
10340080 HAVE ANOTHER DO ANYTHING FOR MYSELF THE FIRST TWO WEEKS AFTER SURGERY I HAVE MY PARENTS WITH ME ONE OF THEM AT EVERY EVERY POINT IN TIME IMMEDIATELY POST-OP 
10340081 I'M LUCKY ENOUGH TO LIVE STILL NEARBY WHERE I GREW UP SO I NEED TO HAVE PARENTS YOU KNOW WHO DO CARE AND WHO WOULD BE THERE FOR ME 
10340082 WORRYING VERY WORRYING YEAH EVERY TIME THIS KIND OF AN ALL OR NOTHING MAKE IT OR BREAK IT EVENT
10340083 RIGHT THIS COULD BE THE TIME WHERE I FIND OUT THAT OH I ACTUALLY DO HAVE CANCER AGAIN RIGHT YOU KNOW THEY TAKE YOUR YOUR WEIGHT AND YOUR BLOOD PRESSURE AND YOUR TEMPERATURE EVERY TIME YOU COME IN
10340084 TO THE HOSPITAL RIGHT AND MY BLOOD PRESSURE IS ROUTINELY LIKE THIRTY POINTS HIGHER EVERY TIME BEFORE AN ONCOLOGY APPOINTMENT THAN IT IS WHENEVER I SEE A REGULAR DOCTOR 
10340085 YEAH BUT LUCKILY THAT IT DIDN'T DIDN'T COME BACK IT'S BEEN TWO YEARS NOW THE LAST LAST CHECKUP

10340087 MORE LIKE THIS IS JUST A PART OF MY BIANNUAL OR ANNUAL MAINTENANCE IT'S REALLY NOT LIKELY TO MOUNT ANYTHING I JUST DO THIS TO MAKE SURE I STAY HEALTHY 
10340088 WHEREAS BEFORE THIS IS YOU KNOW IT WAS MORE TO MAKE SURE THAT I AM HEALTHY THAT I DON'T ACTUALLY LIKE I DON'T CURRENTLY HAVE CANCER AND ME STILL AND IT DIDN'T
10340089 COME BACK HE DIDN'T RELAPSE THERE'S REALLY NO GOOD TIME TO GET A DIAGNOSIS LIKE THIS RIGHT BUT THIS IS PROBABLY THE BEST
10340090 POSSIBLE TIME YOU COULD EVER GET ONE THING I'M THINKING ABOUT THE TREATMENTS ARE AVAILABLE NOW AS OPPOSED TO EVEN DECADES AGO THAT THERE THERE ARE TREATMENTS
10340091 RIGHT THOUSANDS YEARS AGO NOTHING HUNDRED YEARS AGO NOTHING EVEN DECADES AGO THEY'RE WORK IT REALLY NEED VIABLE TREATMENTS THAT HAD A HIGH SUCCESS RATE 
10340092 WITH YOU KNOW MINIMAL OR LOW COMPLICATIONS WHEREAS NOW THERE THERE ARE GOOD ODDS DEFINITELY STICK WITH WHATEVER YOUR DOCTORS 
10340093 RECOMMEND THEIR PHYSICAL THERAPY DOCTORS OR YOUR MEDICAL PRACTITIONERS BE SURE YOU JUST FOLLOW ALL THEIR ADVICE HELP YOUR RECOVERY GO SMOOTHER
