## Phoneme and articulatory analysis framework for Kaldi ASR

This work is the reproduction of the figures in the paper (TODO: insert name)

The code in this repository can be used to calculate relative phoneme error rates and relative articulatory error
rates using a Kaldi wer_details file.

### Instructions

Create the conda environment from environment yml

Run analysis.py

### Adaptation for your own datasets

Put your wer_details experiments in the same format as the other experiments into the folder experiments.
Adapt the script analysis.py to your own use case, i.e legend title should represent your own ASR architectures.




### TODO

* Create environment.yml file
